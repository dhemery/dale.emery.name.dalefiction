Jeremy waited in the shadows of Mrs. Stilson’s carport.  Before he ran away he had hidden here many times as he played with Gil, Deena, and the other kids from the neighborhood.  From his vantage point he could see his house and, to the west, the three houses between his and the end of the street.  If Mrs. Stilson came home he would have to scramble to get out of the way, and maybe to explain himself.  But she kept a late shift at the hospital.  Or, at least, she used to.  As Jeremy was learning, a lot could change in a year.

Mr. and Mrs. Wentworth might be a problem.  Their house neighbored Jeremy’s to the east, and was directly across the street from Mrs. Stilson’s.  The Wentworths might see him.  They might recognize him, but just as likely they would not.  With their poor eyesight they often failed to see what was there, and with their generally suspicious nature they sometimes saw things that weren’t there.  Even before Jeremy ran away they sometimes spied him skulking in the Stilsons’ carport, thought he was some delinquent, and came running out to shoo him away.

Jeremy moved further back into the shadows.  He could see less well here, but he was also harder to spot from across the street.  He looked for something to sit on.  He found a plastic bucket and turned upside down in the corner.  It scraped on the concrete as he sat down.

Jeremy heard footsteps on the sidewalk, surprising him.  He held his breath.  As he tensed, the bucket collapsed under him.  Jeremy fell, smashing his left elbow on the concrete, sending a bolt of pain up his arm.

He looked up and there was Deena.

They stared at each other for a moment.  Then Deena laughed and said, “What are you doing?”

His sister’s laugh sounded so sweet!

“Deena,” Jeremy said, and no further words came.  “Deena.”

Deena’s laugh stopped abruptly.  She looked intently at Jeremy.

Jeremy wanted to run to his little sister and hug her.  He tried to stay calm as he got up off the ground and took a step toward her.

Deena stepped back, off the sidewalk and into the street.  “Do I know you?”

<u>Do I--</u>  “Deena, it’s me, Jeremy.”  His voice cracked as he said his name.

“Jeremy,” she repeated.  “You look familiar.”

Jeremy felt a surge of adrenaline.  He tried to stay calm, but he felt the world slipping away from him.  In a panicky voice he said, “’Familiar’?  Deena!  Of <u>course</u> I look familiar, I’m your---”

“<u>Nadine!</u>” a woman’s voice yelled sharply.

Jeremy looked up and saw his mother running toward them from across the street.

Deena looked toward her mother.  “Mom--”

“Nadine, get away from that boy.  Get away from him right now.”

Jeremy said the only thing he could think of.  “Mom, she knows me!”

Jeremy’s mother stopped abruptly in the middle of the street.  With a forced evenness she said, “Nadine, go into the house right this instant and wait for me.”

“Mom!” Jeremy shouted.  “She said she knows me!  Deena said she knows me!”

Jeremy’s mother turned quickly to Deena.  Sternly she said, “Do you know this boy?”

Deena burst into tears.  “No!” she cried, shaking her head.

Jeremy shouted, “Deena!  You said you know me!”

“Liar!” Deena yelled.  “That’s not what I said!” She turned and fled toward the house.

Jeremy’s mother glared at him and reached into her pocket.  She pulled out a cell phone and dialled three digits.  As she put the phone to her ear she said, “We’re going to put a stop to this right now.”

At the house across the street, the front door opened and Mr. Wentworth peered out, adjusting his glasses.

Jeremy ran.
