Deena watched the door slam.

"Hey!" she yelled.  "What did you do that for?"

Gil took a long breath.

Deena said, "But what about Aaron?  That man knows Aaron."

"No, he doesn't, Deena."

"Yes he does.  He said--"

"That man was playing a joke on us.  A very mean joke, just like that boy the other day."

"But--"

"Deena, listen to me." Gil said, kneeling in front of her and taking her hands in his.  "I want you to listen to me, okay?"

She nodded.  Had she done something wrong?

"If anybody tries to talk to you, anybody you don't know, I want you to run away as fast as you can.  Scream if you have to, but get away from them as fast as you can."

"I know that.  'Don't talk to strangers.'"

"I know, sweetie.  But this is extra important.  If somebody tries to talk to you, you let me know, okay?"

Deena nodded.

"And if anybody calls you 'Deena,' you let me know."

"But I <u>am</u> Deena!"

Gil squeezed her hands gently.  "Deena, please.  This is--"

"Virgil!" Mom half shouted, barely audible from the bedroom.  "Virgil what's all that banging?"

"Someone at the door, Mom.  Some salesman."

"What?  Come in here where I can hear you."

Gil looked at Deena.  "If anybody tries to talk to you.  If anybody calls you Deena.  Okay?"

But--  "Okay."

"Go finish your dinner.  I'll be back in a minute and we can clean up."

Gil turned and walked through the living room toward their mother's bedroom.

Deena looked toward the front door.   That man said that he knew where Aaron was.

Deena heard a squeek from the mail slot by the front door, followed by a small clunk.  Something fell from the mail slot onto the floor.

Deena ran to pick it up.  A small card.  Written on it in messy handwriting were two names, Aaron Crowther and Page Foley.  Beside each name was a phone number.

"Nadine!  What did I just tell you!"

Deena jumped and spun.

Gil stomped toward her looking very angry.

"But nobody talked to me!" Deena cried.

Gil ripped the card from her hand.  He looked at it.  "Jesus," he said, and gripped the card with both hands.

Gil no longer looked angry.  Now he looked scared.  Suddenly Deena was scared, too, though she didn't know why.

"Deena, you have to be more careful," Gil said without looking up from the card.  "You have to be more careful."
