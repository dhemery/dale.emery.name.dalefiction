Foley stared at the cell phone.

What the hell had just happened?  At first Aaron had been incredulous that Natalie Crowther had not remembered her own son.  Then he had been surprised that she had remembered him.  And then Aaron had claimed not to even have a brother named Jeremy.

Nothing made sense.  Foley felt disoriented, as he had fifty years earlier when the world as he knew it--or the world as it knew him--had shifted out from under him.

Foley had finally come to accept that his family, the Army, the newspaper, the world had forgotten his past.  He could not explain it, but he had come to accept it.

And now something similar had happened to Jeremy.  But with Jeremy, his brother Aaron seemed to remember.  Even though Jeremy lost the rest of his family, even though Jeremy's newspaper story had changed, Aaron seemed to remember.

Aaron seemed to remember.

Seemed.

Something didn't fit.

Did Aaron remember Jeremy, or didn't he?  If he did remember, why would he claim that he did not?

And if he did not remember, why had he sent that slimey Mortenson to bring Jeremy to him?

And what was Aaron's last question just before he hung up on Foley?  "How did you happen to call my mother a year ago?"  Why was Aaron so interested in that?

Dammit, it made no sense.  It made no sense.

But Foley was sure of two things.

Something in Aaron's story did not fit.

And Jeremy Crowther was in danger.
