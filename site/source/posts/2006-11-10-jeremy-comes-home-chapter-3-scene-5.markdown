<em>NOTE:  When Jeremy bolted from the library, that allowed me to insert this little interlude.  I've known this was coming but I didn't know when.

Aaron Crowther paced the tightly woven pale green carpet that lined the floor of the basement of the First Congregational Church of Seattle.  Nils Rollins sat on the edge of a wooden utility table with his arms crossed across his chest.

"This was today?" Aaron asked.

"Terry just called me today.  I think the kid showed up yesterday or the day before."

"What did Terry say, exactly?"

"He said that a kid showed up at Gil's school claiming to be Gil's brother.  Then he showed up at Deena's school, and when Gil showed up they got in a big fight.  Gil left the kid bleeding on the grass."

"Anything else?"

"A few rumors.  Terry heard that the kid had showed up at your house, and that he had broken in.  That's like third-hand information, though."

Forty grey metal folding chairs took up the center of the room, arranged in five rows with an aisle dividing twenty on the left from twenty on the right.  Aaron stopped pacing in front of the chair to the left of the aisle in the front row and sat down.

"Where's the kid now?"

"I don't know.  Terry hasn't actually seen him himself."

Aaron leaned forward and placed his elbows on his knees.  His head fell forward and he laced his fingers behind his neck.

Nils said, "Do you think he's one of us?"

"That would be a hell of a coincidence," Aaron said.  "A Forgotten in my own family."

"What do you want to do?"

"See if Terry can find the kid and get more information.  If he's a Forgotten, he will be making a damned nuisance of himself for a few days.  He should be pretty easy to find."
