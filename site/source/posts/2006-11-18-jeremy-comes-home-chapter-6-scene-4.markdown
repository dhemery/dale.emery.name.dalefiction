The number had a Portland, Oregon area code.  Foley pushed the talk button, then held the cell phone to his ear.  He listened to the line ring once, then twice.

"Terry, what's up?"

"Is this Aaron Crowther?"

A pause.  "Who is this?"

"My name is Page Foley.  I'm a friend of Jeremy's."

"Not his grandfather?"

"No, I'm not his grandfather."  Shit.  How did Aaron know about that?  That lie was continuing to complicate things.  "So you know what's been going on down here?"

"I know you're messing where you don't belong.  Who the hell are you?  And why are you fucking around with Jeremy?"

"I tell you what.  I'll answer any questions you have for me, and then I'll ask you some questions.  Fair enough?"

"Depends on the questions."

Shit.  Aaron was not going to make this easy.  But what choice did Foley have?  "Okay.  You asked who I am.  I've given you my name."

"I also asked you why you're fucking around with little boys."

"Jeremy is in a bit of a predicament, and I'm trying to help him out.  And maybe he can help me in return."

"An old man, a stranger, helping a twelve-year old boy and looking for help in return.  That sounds pretty creepy."

"You have a cynical mind."

"I've seen a lot of kids who have been abused, Mister Foley.  Don't you watch the news?"

"You have a point, Mister Crowther.  I can assure you--"

"How are you helping that young man?"

That young man?  That was a strange way for Aaron to refer to his brother.  "Jeremy's mother seems not acknowledge that he is her son."

Foley heard only silence on the line.  "Aaron?"

"Give me a minute.  You're talking nonsense.  You say his mother doesn't acknowledge that he is her son?"

Shit.  Foley couldn't think how to explain.

Aaron spoke again.  "What makes you think she is his mother?"

"Because a year ago she seemed quite upset by his running away."

"You--  You talked to her?"

"That's right.  After Jeremy ran away."

"And she remembered him?"  Aaron sounded surprised.

"Yes," Foley said.  "Wait a minute.  Why are you so surprised that she would remember her own son?"

Again Foley heard a long silence.

"Aaron, why are you so surprised that your mother would remember her own son?"

"Because, Mister Foley, or whoever you are, I don't have a brother named Jeremy."

What the hell?  Suddenly the entire conversation made no sense.  The events earlier with Jeremy and Mortenson made no sense.  Hadn't Mortenson said that his brother wanted to see him?  Had Mortenson said "brother?"

"Mister Foley?"

"Forgive me, Mister Crowther, I'm at a loss here.  An hour ago a man named Mortenson came to my house.  He told Jeremy that his brother Aaron wanted to see him."

"Mister Foley, I have one more question for you, and then I'll tell you anything you want to know."

"Okay."

"How did you happen to call my mother a year ago?"

"I saw a poster asking for information about Jeremy, who had apparently gone missing.  I had seen Jeremy several days earlier, so I called Natalie to let her know."

Foley waited for a response.

"Aaron?"

Silence.

Foley looked at the cell phone's display.  It said, "Call terminated."
