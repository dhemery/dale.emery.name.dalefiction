"Deena," Gil said, "I want to talk to you."

Deena sat on the floor with her back to him.  She pointed to the television in front of her.  "I'm watching."

"Deena, please.  This is important."

Deena continued to watch the television.

Okay, if this was the way she was going to be, Gil would have to get her attention first.

"Nadine."

Deena whirled around and glared at Gil.  "My name is Deena.  We agreed."

"Yes, we did Deena.  That's what I want to talk about.  Your name."

"What about my name?"

"Where did it come from?  Where did you get the idea to call yourself Deena?"

"I made it up.  It's like how Gil is the end of Virgil.  Deena is the end of Nadine."

"I know, sweetie.  You said that before.  But it's kind of sudden."

"It's a nice name."  Deena crossed her arms and pouted.

"Yes, it is a nice name.

Her pout deepened.  "Then why can't I be Deena?"

"Deena, no, I'm not--  You can be Deena.  I like it."

"Then stop bugging me and let me watch TV."  Deena turned back around.

Gil picked up the remote control and turned the TV off.

"Hey!  I was watching that!"

"Deena, I have a question for you.  Then you can watch whatever you want."

"I can watch it now."

"Deena, please--"

"You're not the boss of me."

Gil held up the remote control and waggled it.  "Well, I have this, so I guess that makes me the boss of the TV."

Deena stood up.  "I'm going to take a bed day."

Gil felt a chill run down his spine.  Then he surprised himself by bursting out laughing.

Deena crossed her arms, pouted, and sighed, managing to do all three dramatically.  Then she too began laughing.

Gil patted the cushion beside him on the couch.  "Come sit with me, sweetie.  I just have an easy question."

Deena came and sat, leaving no space between Gil and her self.  Then she wriggled even closer.  "Give me some room."

Gil wriggled closer instead of further away.  "How's that?"

She looked up at him with mock curiosity.  "Well, what's your big question?"

"Where did you get the idea to call yourself Deena?"

"I already told you."

"No, you told me that Deena is short for Nadine.  But why do you want to call yourself Deena?"

A look of guilt crossed Deena's face.  She looked toward the television.  "I want to watch TV now."

"Deena, please."

"You'll be mad."

"Why would I be mad?"  But he knew.  And he knew that he knew.  He wouldn't be pushing so hard if he didn't already know her answer.

She looked up at him, fixing her eyes intently on his.  "Promise you won't be mad."

"I promise.  I won't be mad."

Deena crossed her arms and looked at her knees.

Gil put a hand on her shoulder.

"It was that boy."

"What boy, Deena?"  He needed to hear her say it.

"That boy who came here.  The boy you beat up at school.  He called me Deena."

Okay, so now he knew.  Deena had confirmed what he had guessed, what he had feared.  Now what?  If Aaron, the kid, and the old man all called Nadine Deena...  Then...  Then what?

"I knew you'd be mad."

"What?  No, Deena, I'm not mad.  I'm just thinking."

She held out her hand.

Gil gave her the remote control.
