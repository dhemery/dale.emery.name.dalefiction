Near Mayfield Park, Mendel Street briefly split into a divided road.  The divider, mostly covered in grass, widened into a small community garden centered around a large two-tier fountain.

By eleven PM, the neighborhood residents had finished walking their dogs and the street was quiet.  Jeremy stood in the garden and washed his garbage-clotted clothes in the fountain.  He wore his one other pair of jeans and one other shirt, red plaid flannel.  These, too, were dirty, but that was everyday grime, not garbage, but he would have to wash these clothes soon.

When he finished, he wrung the sopping shirt and jeans over a bed of yellow flowers.  “Extra protein for you tonight,” he said.

He walked slowly back to the park, his hands cold and wet as he held the shirt in one hand and the jeans in the other, away from his body so that they wouldn’t soak the clothes he was wearing.

He couldn’t hang the dripping clothes on a bench.  That would attract the attention of any passing police.  He found an alley behind a row of houses, and hung his clothes there on a vine-covered fence.

This was supposed to be Jeremy’s second night back with his family.  They were supposed to be still surprised and excited to see him again.  He was supposed to have apologized for the thirtieth time for abandoning his family and scaring them, and they were supposed to have now-nowed him for at least the tenth.

But instead he sat in a dark alley half a block from Mayfield park, cold, wet, and more alone than he had ever felt in his short life.

He sat with his knees pulled up to his chin, and his arms wrapped around his knees, and wondered what in the world he was going to do now.

He wanted to run.  He wanted to stuff everything he owned into his backpack, buy a bus ticket even if it cost his last thirty dollars, and flee Sacramento for good.

His head throbbed.  He rubbed his temples with the heels of his hands.

He could not go back to Seattle.  Not with what waited for him there.  He could live on the street, he knew that.  He knew that he could take care of himself.  But he needed a rest.

No, he could not run.  He wanted his family back.  He needed his family back.

But his family had gone mad.  The world had gone mad.

Or he had gone mad.

The thought struck him like a kick in the head.  If everything I see, everything I hear, everything that everyone around me does, if everything around me seems insane, there's one obvious way to explain it.

It isn't the world that's gone mad.  It is me.

I must be losing my mind.  I must have made this all up.  None of this is real.  My mother isn't real.  I made her up.  And Deena and Gil.  I made them up, too.  I'm so desperate for a family that I invented one.  None of this is really happening.

That would explain it.

Except that it wouldn't.

Jeremy touched his cheek, still throbbing from where Gil punched him.  The pain was real enough.  The swollen flesh around his cheekbone was real enough.  Gil's fist had been real enough.

Madness was not an explanation.  It explained nothing.  He had known what his mother and brother and sister looked like.  He had known their names.  He had known that Aaron had run away, and that his mother and Gil were still overwhelmed by the loss.

He had known about Gil's baseball card.  And he had known about the miracle double play that won the little league championship.  If he hadn't been there, how could he know about those things?

But his memory had been twisted.  It wasn't he who had been the hero of the baseball game.  It had been Christian Cavezos.  Had he warped the memory in his mind to make himself out to be the hero?

But he remembered so vividly the feel of Jimmy's lightning ground ball in his glove.  He remembered so vividly how his heart had lept as he watched the ball sail high over first base.  And he remembered the elation he felt when he saw Manny's glove wrap around the ball.  He remembered every image.  Not from second base or from the dugout.  Not from the stands.  Not from the TV news.

The images in his mind were not as if he were watching the events, but as if he were catching the ball and throwing it.

Could he have distorted his memory that much?  Could Aiden be right, that Jeremy needed glory so much that he would steal it from Christian Cavezos, with no more remorse than stealing a five dollarbill from an unattended gas station cash register?

Jeremy rejected the thought.  Even if he could have watched the baseball game and imagined himself the star, that still didn't explain what he knew about Gil and the loose baseboard and burning the Pedro Martinez baseball card.  How could he have known about those things if he wasn't there?

Gil had given an explanation.  Jeremy had been in the house, snooping around.  What if Gil were right?  Jeremy didn't remember sneaking through the house, but if he could imagine himself the star of a baseball game he had never played in, he could surely suppress the memory of snooping in a strange house.

But even if he had been in the house, that didn't explain how he knew why Gil had burned the card.  When Pedro threw Don Zimmer to the ground, Gil had been disgusted, and that's why he had burned the card.  How could he know that if Gil hadn't told him?

Jeremy thought back over that horrible fight this morning at the school.  Gil had confirmed the story about the baseball card.  Hadn't he?

What had he said, exactly?

<u>How did you know about that?  I never told anyone about that!</u>

What did Gil mean?  That he had never told anyone about hiding the card, or that he had never told anyone his reasons?

Jeremy wasn't sure.  And he couldn't ask now.

Jesus, this was insane.  There's that word again.

Jeremy sighed.  If the explanation came down to such fine details, he was royally screwed.  Whatever the details said, whether he had lost his mind or the universe had made a side step into absurdity, either way his family seemed to be lost to him.  He seemed to be without a home to return to.

In his best Rod Serling through-the-teeth voice, Jeremy said, "Jeremy Crowther came home to resume the life he had left behind.  But the past that he remembered now existed only in... the twilight zone."

Either Jeremy was crazy, or the universe had tilted three degrees on its axis.  Those were the choices.

<u>So what do I do now?</u> he thought.  <u>If those are my choices, what do I do now?</u>

The answer became obvious at the moment he formed the question.  If he was crazy, there was no harm in acting as if he were sane.  And if the universe had lost a screw or two (Finnie's would have a replacement), there was no harm in regarding it sanely.

Jeremy groaned.  <u>What kind of logic is that?</u>

Another part of him answered, <u>It's logic enough for now.
</u>
He laughed out loud.  Far down the alley a dog barked.

<u>Logic enough for now.</u>

Back to basics.  <u>What do I want here?  I want my family back.  I want my family back.</u>

But how could he get his family back?  They denied that he even existed.

There were moments, though.  There were moments when he thought he was close to breaking through, close to making contact.  Deena thought he looked familiar.  When Jeremy had told his mother that Deena recognized him, she had stopped denying it for just a second to ask Deena whether it was true.

When he had told Gil about the baseball card, Gil had paused for just a second before exploding.

In each of those cases, Jeremy had offered a tiny bit of evidence, a tiny bit of confirmation of what he was saying.  In each case, his mother or his brother had paused to consider the evidence.  In each case they had rejected the evidence.  And in each case they had reacted even more angrily.  But in those two instants there had been a glimmer of hope.

Evidence.  If he could provide evidence, evidence that they could not deny...

Where could he find undeniable evidence?  Evidence that his mother and his brother could not dismiss?

In the house, maybe.  His toys.  His Mark Twain book collection.  But there was nothing about those that marked them as Jeremy's.  They could belong to Gil or Deena or anyone.

Pictures?  His scrapbook, maybe.  He had kept a scrapbook of pictures and a few newspaper articles.  He had an autographed copy of Neil Gaiman's <u>Anansi Boys</u>.  "To Jeremy," it said.  "Keep well, and don't look under the bed."

Pictures would be proof!  Gaiman's inscription would be proof!

But this proof--it it existed--was in the house.  There was no way Jeremy could go into the house.  Gil had made that clear.

What then?  His birth certificate.  That would be on file somewhere, in some government building.  Would they give a copy to Jeremy?  He didn't think so.  He was a kid with no identification.

Fingerprints!  He had been fingerprinted three years ago along with all of the other fourth graders at Ferrar Elementary.  His fingerprints would be on file at the police station.  He could...

What?  March into the police station and ask for a copy of his fingerprints so that he could prove to his mother that he was her son?

Evidence.  He needed a way to find evidence.  He needed...

The newspaper!  He had told Aidan, <u>My name was in the newspaper.</u>  The headline on page D7 of the Sacramento Bee had read, "Jason's Takes East Sac Crown."  The second paragraph had said, "All star third baseman Jeremy Crowther ended the game with a thrilling double play, nabbing a blinding ground ball from James Tremblay and robbing the Kinko's slugger of a game-tying hit."  Jason remembered every word.

The newspaper!  The newspaper had the evidence.  He would find a copy of the newspaper and take it to his mother.

It may not convince her that he was her son, but it would be a start.

And it was his only hope.
