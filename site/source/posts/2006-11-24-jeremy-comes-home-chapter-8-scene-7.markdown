Jeremy heard a buzzing sound.  Aaron reached into his pocket and pulled out a cell phone.  "Excuse me just a minute.  I have to take this call."  He stepped away from Jeremy and Nils and moved to the back of the room, speaking quietly into the cell phone.

Nils said, "Your brother has been something of a savior to me."  He glanced at the ceiling and smiled.  "If I can say that in here."

"A savior?"

"To all of us, really."

All of us?  Jesus!  How many of "us" were there?

Nils apparently noticed Jeremy's shock.  "Aaron didn't tell you?"

"He said there were others, but...  How many?"

"Twenty six.  You're the twenty seventh."

"Jesus!" Jeremy blurted.  "Jesus!"  He remembered what Foley had said about feeling both horrified that someone else was going through this, and relieved that he wasn't the only one.

Nils said, "I know this is a shock for you.  It's a lot to take in."

Aaron rejoined them.  "Forgive me, Jeremy, but I have to go out for a while.  Nils will take good care of you.  And he knows more than I do about what you're going through."

Aaron turned and walked hurriedly across the room and up the stairs.

Jeremy turned to Nils.  Nils shrugged.
