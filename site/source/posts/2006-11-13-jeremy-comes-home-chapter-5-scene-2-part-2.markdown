How does a piece of paper forget you?  It doesn't, of course.  A newspaper doesn't forget.  A poster for a missing child doesn't forget.  And they certainly don't spontaneously change the stories written on them and the people who played the starring roles in those stories.

"Jeremy?"

"Huh?  Oh.  What did you say?"

"How does a piece of paper forget you?"

"It doesn't, obviously."

Foley pointed at the poster of the missing boy.  "That one did."

"Maybe somebody changed the posters.  Took down the one about me and put up one about Paul Quinn."

"Plausible, but no.  I took that poster off the telephone pole and brought it into the house to call the phone number that was written on it.  I never put it back up."

"Someone broke into your house, then."

"So they could remove the poster about you and replace it with one about Paul Quinn?  Does that seem likely to you?"

"No."

"So how does a piece of paper forget you?"

"How do I know that piece of paper ever said anything other than Paul Quinn?  How do I know you're telling the truth?"

"Good question," said Foley.  "I don't think it leads anywhere useful, but let's try it on for size.  Let's suppose I'm lying to you.  How does that explain what you've been through over the past three days?"

"How do you know about that?  Unless you're involved..."

"I don't know all that much, Jeremy, but you've certainly been through something enormous.  On Friday morning I saw you getting the snot kicked out of you, and--"

"You saw that?"

"Yes, and also I heard you screaming at that boy that you were his brother.  'I'm your brother!'  That's a strange thing to yell at someone who is beating the snot out of you."

Jeremy flashed on images of his brother punching and kicking him.  Jeremy had been too stunned and heartbroken to defend himself.

"That was my brother."

"'Gil,' I think you called him.  Gil Crowther is his name?"

"Yes."

"So now the question is more complex.  How does a piece of paper and your brother forget you?  An old man lying to you doesn't explain that."

Jeremy thought of his conspiracy theory, a theory built of shadows and fog.  "Unless you were in on that, too."

"I made your brother forget you?"

"Maybe you're a hypnotist."

"And your mother, too, I suppose?"

"Yes, and my sister."

"You have a sister?"

"Yes," Jeremy said.  "The one you hypnotized."

"All right," Foley said, nodding.  "So here's what we have so far.  I hypnotized your family and lied to you about the missing person poster.  Does that about cover it?"

"And Aiden Corliss, too," Jeremy added, realizing that Foley was right, that even if Foley was lying, that didn't come close to explaining what had happened.

"Who is Aidan Corliss?  Someone else who has forgotten you?"

Jeremy nodded.

Foley asked, "Where are we in our theory?"

Jeremy decided to stretch the ridiculous thread of logic until it snapped.  "You're lying about the poster, and you hypnotized my whole family and a kid from my baseball team."

"How about your other teammates?  Have you talked with them yet?"

"No, but thanks, that's a good idea.  I'll have to do that."

"And friends and schoolmates.  And teachers.  People you used to know."

Jeremy shrugged.  "Right, them too."

"You don't sound very hopeful."

"No."

"Because I got to them already and hypnotized them all?"

Jeremy shook his head.  "No."

"There's something else, then."

Jeremy nodded.  "The newspaper changed."

"The newspaper?"  Foley looked puzzled for a second, then put the pieces together.  "Ah.  The scene in the library."

Jeremy nodded.

"You sure were in a hurry to get out of there.  To the McKinley Park library."

Jeremy suddenly sat up straight.  "Hey!  I tripped over you.  What were you doing there?"

"I followed you," Foley said.  "A bit too closely, it turns out."

Jeremy stood up.  "Why the hell were you following me?"

"When I saw that boy beating you up, I thought you looked familiar.  And your name sounded familiar.  I remembered you from that poster you're holding."

Jeremy looked at the poster again.

Foley said, "One day it said 'Jeremy Crowther.'  The next day it said, 'Paul Quinn.'  That's not the kind of thing that happens every day."

"Jesus," Jeremy said.  "You saw it change!"

"Well, I didn't see it, exactly, but it changed from one day to the next.  A few days after I talked to your mother I saw a new poster on the telephone pole, one that looked like the one you're holding."

"Paul Quinn."

"Right.  The second poster surprised me.  Two runaway boys in a few days.  That's not a common thing.  When I got home I looked at the poster I'd taken down."

"And it said Paul Quinn."

"Right."

"Jesus," Jeremy said.

"Yeah, Jesus."

"So what did you do?"

"Before we talk about that, let me ask you a question."

"Okay."

"I'm telling you a story about a poster about a missing boy, a poster that changed from one boy to another overnight.  This is a crazy story, right?  Completely unbelievable?"

"Well..."

"And you aren't batting an eye.  Why not?"

"What?"

"You believe my story, Jeremy.  Why?"

Foley was right.  His story was completely insane, and Jeremy believed every word of it.

Because as insane as the story was, it fit right in with the insanity that had been Jeremy's last three days.

Jeremy felt a tingle in his shoulders.

"Because it fits."

"It fits what?"

"It fits what's happening to me.  My family forgets me.  Aidan forgets me.  The newspaper story changes.  The police can't find my fingerprints.  Your story is nuts, but it fits."

Foley said, "Tell me about the newspaper story."

"You first," Jeremy said.  "Tell me what happened after the poster changed."

"Okay," Foley said.  "This may be a little hard for you to hear, but I guess it's more of what you've seen already.  When I saw that the poster said Paul Quinn, I called your mother.  I had to look up the number in the phone book because the poster had a different number.  Your mother..."

Jeremy sat forward in the chair.  "My mother what?"

"Your mother had no idea what I was talking about."

"What do you mean?  What did you say?"

"When she came on the phone, I told her who I was, and asked her if she had any news about you.  About Jeremy.

"She said, 'Jeremy who?'

"'Your son, Jeremy,' I said.

"She told me, 'You must have the wrong number'"

Jeremy sat, numb.

Foley continued.  "I asked her about her son who had run away, and she said another name.  Andy, I think--"

"Aaron," Jeremy said thickly.

"Yes, that was it.  Aaron.  She asked me if I knew something about him.  We had a confused conversation for a few minutes before I realized that she was talking about another son who had run away, apparently quite some time before.  I quickly made my apologies and ended the call."

Two days!  Two days after Jeremy had run away his mother had forgotten that he had ever existed.

For some reason this realization hit Jeremy hard.  His family was lost to him.  It had been lost not for three days, but for a whole year.  The family that for the past year he had thought of, and cried for, and vowed to return to one day, his family had forgotten him within days of his running away.  Even if he had returned within days, there would have been no family to return to.

In the state he had been in when he ran away he would not have been ready, would not have been able to bear the confusion and pain and grief.

He was barely holding up to it now.  In a year on the streets he had learned to take care of himself.  He had learned to bear the emotions that churned inside him.

But a year ago he had been so torn apart inside that he had to run.  A year ago he would not have been able to bear what he was going through right now.  It would have killed him.

Quietly Jeremy said, "My God, it happened a  year ago."

He looked at Foley and his eyes filled with tears.  "I never had a chance to come home.  My God, I never had a chance."
