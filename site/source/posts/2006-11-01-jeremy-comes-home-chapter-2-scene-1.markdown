Jeremy sat shaking on a bench in Mayfield Park.  In the three days since he had decided to return home he had thought of dozens of ways--mostly horrible--that things would turn out.  He had imagined, but not dared to hope, that his family would drop to their knees in thanks that their runaway Jeremy had come home.  Of course that had been to much to hope for.

Most of the scenarios he had imagined had been darker.  He had feared that his mother would shout at him for putting her through a year of hell.  He even imagined that his mother, brother, and sister might not care one way or another that he had come home.  That was the worst that he imagined.

But this, this was beyond his imagining.  His mother had not recognized him.  Had not acknowledged him.

“Hateful,” she had called him.  And she had closed the door in his face.  His own mother had closed the door in his face.

Perhaps his running away had been more traumatic than he had believed.  He had known it would be hard for her, and for Gil and Deena.  He had known, and he had left anyway.  He had left for his own sanity.  Leaving was selfish and he knew it.  He knew it as he was planning.  He knew it as he was writing the note telling them not to worry, that he would be okay.  He knew it as he had walked away from Cherry Lane toward the bus stop.  He knew it would be hard.  And he had left anyway.

He left because he could no longer handle the pain.  His mother’s pain at being abandoned, first by her husband and then by her oldest son, had been to great for him to bear.  Jeremy had known that the only thing he could do, to run away from the pain, would be hard on the family.  He had known that.  But he didn’t know what else to do, and he had left to find a place with no pain but his own.  He had left to find some peace.

Had it been too much for his mother?  She of course had been fragile.  For too long she had been fragile.

Had Jeremy’s leaving been too much?  Had she pushed him out of her memory to save herself the pain of losing another son?  Had she snapped?  Had she been pushed from depression to something worse, something darker?

Jeremy pushed the thought from his mind.  This was going to be harder than he thought.  He had to think of what to do next.

He didn’t dare to go back to the house on Cherry Lane.  Whatever his mother might do, he didn’t want to upset her further.

Should he call his father in New York?  He wasn’t sure that the phone number he had was current.  And getting his father involved might disrupt his mother even more.

Jesus.  What had he done?

The only other option was to talk to Gil.  He closed his eyes at the thought.  Gil had borne up better to their mother’s depression.  He had somehow been able to shrug it off.  Though Jeremy had thought Gil cold, he sometimes wished he had the same talent for enduring pain, or ignoring it, or simply refusing to acknowledge it.

Gil didn’t acknowledge pain.  But he knew anger.  Jeremy was not eager to face an angry fifteen-year-old.

But what else could he do?

Jeremy looked at his watch.  It was 2:15 pm.  Gil would be at school.  If he left now, Jeremy could walk the 15 blocks in time to catch Gil as school let out for the day.
