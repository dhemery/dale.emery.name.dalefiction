Jeremy stood at the telephone booth at the truck stop with a finger in his left ear.  Even so he could barely hear the phone ringing.

The phone stopped ringing.  Jeremy thought he heard Foley say "hello," but he wasn't sure.

"Page?  Page, speak up, I can barely hear you."

A voice said, "Jeremy?"

A woman's voice.

Who the hell?  Then Jeremy made a guess.  "Officer Yonce?"

"Where are you, Jeremy?"

"That's not important right now, offi--"

"It's important to me.  Abducting children is serious business."

"No!  Nobody abducted me!"  Some of the people in the booths and at the dining counter looked up at Jeremy from whatever they were eating.  Jeremy turned his back to the dining room and spoke more quietly.  "Officer Yonce, I'm alone.  Page didn't come with me."

"Where is Mister Foley now, Jeremy?"

"I don't know.  If he was with me, why would I be calling him?"

"Maybe to leave a message on his voice mail, to make us think you weren't together."

"No!  You have to believe me.  I left him at his house."

"I'd like to believe you, Jeremy, but you've been telling some very tall tales.  And Mister Foley, too, for that matter."

"I'm sorry we lied to you before, but he's not here.  Honest."

"His suitcase is gone, Jeremy."

Jesus, how could he explain?  In desperation, Jeremy tried the truth.  "He was going to come with me.  But then I left by myself."

"But why were you running at all?"

"You know why.  We lied to you and you knew it."

"Why did you lie, Jeremy?"

"I can't explain it!" Jeremy shouted.  He turned to see the same truckers and travelers looking at him.

"Try, Jeremy," Yonce said soothingly.  "Try to explain it.  I'm a good listener."

At the change of tone in Yonce's voice, Jeremy became alarmed.  Damn!  She's tracing the phone!  She was trying to keep Jeremy on the line so she could trace the call.

Jeremy was out of time.  "Officer Yonce, please believe me.  Foley did not come with me.  He did not abduct me.  I am alone.  Please call off the Amber Alert!"

Jeremy hoped he had hung up in time.
