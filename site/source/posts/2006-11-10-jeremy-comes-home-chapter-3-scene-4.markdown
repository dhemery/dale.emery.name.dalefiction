<em>NOTE:  I planned this scene weeks ago.  On Sunday, as I was flying to Phoenix for a conference, I thought of a devastating ending that would allow me to motivate an event or two for the next few scenes.  Monday night was busy for me (selling some training to a colleague) and I didn't write.</em>

<em>On Tuesday night I started writing the scene.   I was worried that it would be too short--I guessed it would come how to 400 words or so--and I wasn't quite ready to start the next scene.</em>

<em>Not having access to the Sacramento Central Library, I made up a bunch of stuff.  In fact, I made up everything except the name of the place.  And I'll probably change that in revision.</em>

<em>As for what happens there, I had in mind a bunch of roadblocks that I could hurl at poor Jeremy, and I wasn't sure which ones I wanted to write about.  As you will see, I took a kitchen sink approach.</em>

<em>I wrote about 1700 words on Tuesday, and was shocked to find that I was nowhere near done with the scene.  Then I wrote another 800 words on Wednesday, and still wasn't done.  I wrote the "final" 900 words on the flight home yesterday.  I put scare quotes around "final" because I'm not done with the action I had intended for the scene--I haven't come to the devastating ending yet.  But Jeremy and his predicament gave me a way to split the scene into two, and to insert another intriguing scene in between.</em>

<em>This first bit came out to nearly 3400 words!  That's longer than any entire story I'd ever written before this month.</em>

<em>On with the story...</em>

At 9 A.M. on Saturday morning, the Sacramento Central Library opened.  At three minutes past nine Jeremy stepped out of the elevator on the third floor of the library.  He scanned the scene in front of him and spotted the racks of dangling newspapers to his right.

He was familiar with the library and its general layout.  He knew that on these racks hung recent copies of newspapers from around the world.  He wasn't interested in recent newspapers, but he'd hoped that there would be archives in a room nearby.

Next to the newspapers were shelves of current magazines.  Beyond the current magazines were shelf upon shelf of magazine archives.  On the shelves were cardboard cartons in which a year of issues of each magazine stood, spines facing outward.

Jeremy walked quickly through the stacks and did not see any archived newspapers.  There were two doors that led to small rooms off the main room.  Both of these rooms held specialty magazines.  Neither held newspapers.

Jeremy looked for an information desk.  As he approached he could see that there was nobody attending the desk.

Near the elevators was a map that showed the layout of each of the six floors of the library.  Beside the map was a listing of different categories of books and other materials, along with the floor number and area where each kind of item could be found.

Jeremy scanned the list.  He did not see a listing for newspaper archives.  He let out a breath he didn't know he had been holding.  He read the list again more slowly.  Nothing.

He pushed the down button for the elevator.  When none of the three elevator doors opened with a few seconds, he turned and walked quickly down the stairs.

On the second floor Jeremy saw an information desk.  A young woman sat behind the desk arranging papers.

As Jeremy approached she looked up and smiled.  "Good morning."

"Hi," Jeremy said.  His mouth was dry.  "Do you have newspapers."

"Up one floor.  Turn right."

"No, I mean old newspapers."

"How old?"

"Last year.  August, 2006."

"A year old...  There are two places to look.  We keep paper copies in the basement for about a year.  Then we dispose of those when we get the fiches."

"Fishes?" said Jeremy, wrinkling his brow.

"F-i-c-h-e.  It's a kind of photograph.  We use those for archives.  You can check out a roll of film and read it on one of the readers on the fourth floor."

"I'm kind of in a hurry," Jeremy said.  "Where would you look first?"

"What are you looking for?"

"A story about my little league team.  We won the championship last year.  There was an article about it in the Bee, and I would like a copy for my scrapbook."

The woman behind the desk sat in thought for a moment.  "You will probably want a really nice copy.  Sometimes the fishes are blurry or have spots.  A paper copy of the newspaper will give you a nicer copy.  I'd look there first."

Jeremy thanked the woman and headed for the stairs.  When he reached the top of the stairs he started quickly downward, then began taking stairs two at a time, then three at a time.  He hit the first floor landing so loudly that the few people in the library foyer looked up sharply.

"Sorry!" Jeremy said, then turned the corner and started down the next flight, one step at a time, to the basement.

The basement was not as well lit as the main library floors.  The air smelled dusty and moldy, and tickled Jeremy's nose.  He pressed a finger under his nose to stifle the sneeze, a trick his mother had taught him.  It almost worked.

"Achoo!"

Jeremy heard his sneeze reverberate sharply and metallically among the metal shelves and brick walls of the library basement.

A man appeared--a kid, really--from among the rows of shelves.

"May I help you?"

"I'm looking for the old newspapers,"  Jeremy said.  "Last year.  Sacramento Bee."

"Come with me," the librarian said.

Jeremy followed him through the maze of shelves.

As they rounded a corner the librarian stopped and pointed.  "This is the Bee," he said.  "They go back for a little over a  year.  The earliest ones are on the left."

Jeremy thanked the man and moved quickly to the stacks of newspapers.  August 19 was the date he looked for.  The championship game had been played that afternoon.  A Saturday.

Jeremy flipped through the newspapers, checking the dates.  The newspapers dated back as far as July 1, 2006.  So mid to late August would be just a little to the right.

Dust flew off the newspapers, filling the air.  Jeremy sneezed again.

August 16, 17, 18...  Yes!  Here it was.  Saturday, August 19, 2006.  Thank goodness!

He remembered that the article was in the sports section, page D7.  He pulled the paper sharply off the shelf, ripping a corner off the front page.  He flipped past sections A, B, and C, pulling them away with his left hand and dropping them onto the floor.

Section D was marked on the top left of the page by a large dark square with a white letter D.  Beside the letter D in large black letters were the words "Business and Investment."

Business and Investment?  That wasn't right, Jeremy thought.  Had he remembered the page number wrong.

He flipped through the remaining two sections that he held in his hand.  Section E, Lifestyle and Entertainment.  Section F, Classified Ads.

He threw the sections that he held, and grabbed the other sections off the floor.  Section A had headlines.  Section B was local news and editorials.  Section C...

Section C, Sports.

"Holy crap," Jeremy muttered.  He shuddered.  His shoulders felt tight.  He took a deep breath.

He closed his eyes and took another breath.  "Please," he mouthed silently.

He opened his eyes and looked at the newspaper.  He was surprised at the wave of relieve that passed through him when he saw the large block letter C and the word Sports still at the top of the page.

Jeremy scooched and spread the sports section out on the floor.  He reached toward the corner of the newspaper and pulled back several pages.  His breathed raggedly and his heart pounded.

Page seven.  Jeremy laid the page flat and scanned the headlines.  A local golf tournament...  An upcoming 10K run...

Nothing about Jason's winning the East Sacramento championship.

Jeremy felt a tingling feeling in his shoulders and along his collarbone.  He blinked hard, then rubbed his eyes with both hands.

Jeremy looked again at page seven.  Nothing about Jason's.  Nothing about little league.

Wait...  There was something.  A headline "East Sac Title Game Today."  He read the start of the two-paragraph article.  "The East Sacramento little league championship will be decided today at Campion Field, where Fed Ex Kinko's will take on Jeremy's Computers..."

"Today!" Jeremy said out loud.  Of course.  How could he have been so stupid.  The game was played on August 19.  The article would not have appeared in that day's newspaper.  It would appear the next day.  August 20.

Jeremy jumped to his feet a little to quickly.  He felt light-headed and grabbed the vertical metal bar of the shelving to steady himself.

When Jeremy felt steadier, he reached for the pile of newspapers.  His hands shook as he touched the newspaper after the one he had been looking at.  He picked it up and looked at the date.

Monday, August 21, 2006.

"Shit!" he said, louder than he had wanted to.  He flipped newspapers.  August 23, 24, 25.

He scanned the papers in the other direction.  August 18, 17, 16.

Where was August 20?

Jeremy moved back and forth from earlier to later newspapers, further and further from the spot where he had found August 19.  Maybe August 20 was filed in the wrong place.

"Hey!" a man's voice said from the end of the aisle.  The library assistant stood looking at the rumple of newspapers around Jeremy's feet.  "You have to treat these with respect.  You can't--"

"Why would one of the papers be missing?" Jeremy said in a demanding tone.

The library assistant crossed his arms and looked Jeremy in the eye.  "Pick those up, very carefully, and put it neatly back on the shelf."

Jeremy opened his mouth to say something, then stopped.  He looked down and saw the sections and sheets of newspaper strewn at his feet.

"Oh, man," Jeremy said.  "Sorry."

"That's a start," the library assistant said.  He pointed at the mess at Jeremy's feet.

Jeremy bent down and began gathering up the strewn sheets, folding them as well as he could into neat sections.

The library assistant moved closer and kneeled down, and helped Jeremy finish cleaning up the newspaper.

Jeremy held up the corner that he had ripped out of the first page.  "Can you fix this?"

"We can probably tape it back on."

"I'm sorry about the mess," Jeremy said.  "I'm looking for an article that's really important to me, and I'm kind of frazzled.  I'm really sorry."

The assistant reached an empty hand toward the newspaper sections that Jeremy was holding.  Jeremy handed over the sections.  The assistant stood and folded the newspaper.

"How about if I help you?" the assistant said.

Jeremy laughed.  "Yeah, okay."

"What are you looking for?"

"August 20.  The sports section, section D.  There's an article about the little league championship in East Sac.  My team won the championship, and I need a copy of the article."

"Ah," the assistant said.  "That is important."

"I said I'm sorry."

"Okay, apology accepted."

"It's for my scrapbook."

"August 20?"

"Right."

The assistant looked down at the newspaper he was holding.

"That's a Sunday.  The Sunday papers are around the corner on the other side of the shelf."

"Gahhh," Jeremy said.  Suddenly tears welled in his eyes.

"Hey, you really are frazzled."

"Yeah, I really am frazzled," Jeremy said.  He blinked and a tear ran down each cheek.  He wiped the tears away with the balls of his hands, and blew a long breath through pursed lips.

"Come on," said the assistant.  Jeremy followed him around the corner.

The front pages of the Sunday papers were in color.

The assistant pointed toward one end of the stacked newspapers.  "You start there.  I'll look here."

Jeremy picked up the first paper.  The date was October 9, 2007.  Three weeks ago.  Jeremy figured that the assistant had deliberately pointed him toward the recent newspapers so that he wouldn't yank them around as he got close to the one he had wanted.

"Any luck?" he said?

"Not yet," said the assistant.  "Oh, wait..."

Jeremy ran the two steps to the assistant's side.

The assistant held two Sunday papers, one in each hand.  He raised the one in his left hand slightly.  "August 13, 2006."  Then the one in his right hand.  "August 27, 2006."

"Where's the 20th?" Jeremy said.

"Maybe misfiled.  Or maybe it's gone."

"Why would it be gone?"

"Sometimes they get damaged."  The assistant glanced at Jeremy, who shrugged his shoulders in a "Hey, I said I'm sorry" gesture.

The assistant placed the two newspapers back on the shelf.

Jeremy said, "If it's okay with you, I'd like to look for the 20th."

The assistant smiled and asked, "And if it's not okay?"

"If it's not okay with you, I'd like to look for the 20th."

The two spent the next ten minutes checking every date on every newspaper, then checking again.

The library assistant said, "I don't think it's here."

"Is there anyplace else it might be?"

"Well, I suppose it could be misfiled anywhere down here in the archives.  Are you up for a full search?"

"If we have to.  Can we check the fishes?"

"The fiches?  Sure.  They're on the fourth floor.  You want me to come along?"

"Yeah," Jeremy said.  "I appreciate that.  With you around I feel less panicky.."

Jeremy and the assistant walked to the elevator and pushed the call button.

The assistant said, "That must have been some game."

"Well, it was an important game," Jeremy said.  "But the article has real sedimental value."

A bell rang, signalling that an elevator car had arrived.

"Sedimental?"

The elevator door opened.

"It's a joke," Jeremy said as he and the assistant got into the elevator.  "Something my brother Aaron used to say."

"Ah."

The elevator started upward.

"You don't have a name tag like the other assistants," Jeremy said.

"I have one, but I forgot it at home this morning.  I'm Will."  The assistant stuck out his hand.

Jeremy took it.  "Jeremy."

The door opened onto the fourth floor, and Will pointed off to the left.  On two tables sat four large machines with switches, levers, and knobs.  A woman sat in front of one of the machines.  Every few seconds she twisted a knob.  With each twist, the machine would whir briefly, and an image projected on onto a glass screen on the front of the machine blurred.  Then the whirring stopped and the image settled onto what Jeremy could see was an image of several columns of newspaper text.

Will said, "Those are the fiche readers.  Basically just big film viewers.  We'll find the reel of film for the August 20 Sacramento Bee and load it up.  You turn the knob to move backward and forward through the images.  When you find the page you want, you push a button and the image prints on one of the printers at the end of the table."

"Where are the films?"

Will led Jeremy to a side room with rows of short shelves, each stuff with plastic cartridges.  On the end of each cartridge was a code number and an abbreviation.

Will ran his finger down a sheet of paper that was taped to a square support column.  "Hmmm," he said.

"What is it?"

"This is the list of films and their contents.  The last entry for the Sacramento Bee is June 30, 2006."

"You mean ..."  Jeremy felt the tingling sensation again in his shoulders and along his collarbones.

"It means that we don't have a fiche of August 20 yet.  Sometimes it takes more than a year before they're transferred from paper to fiche."

"I want to look," Jeremy said.

Will stood aside and gestured for Jeremy to step into the spot he had vacated in front of the support column.

Jeremy stepped up and raised his right hand, with his index finger extended to guide his eye down the page.  His hand was shaking.  He quickly brought his hand down and gripped it in his left.  He left hand was shaking, too.

Jeremy read down the list as carefully as he could.  The last entry read, "KA212.94Z SacBeeJn12-30."

Jeremy's shoulder's slumped.  He turned to Will.  "Where else can we look?"

"There's no place else to look for a copy of the newspaper.  The paper copies in the basement and the microfiches here are our only copies.  Do you need a copy of the story from the printed paper, or would a printout do?"

"Yes!  Will, you're a life saver.  A printout will probably be proof enough."

"Proof?"

Jeremy realized he given more information that he had wanted to.  "Yes.  I'm trying to prove to someone that I was there, in that game.  I made a big play that helped to win the championship."

Will nodded knowingly.  He looked at Jeremy with a twinkle in his eye.  "Trying to impress a girl?"

"Something like that," Jeremy said.  "Where are your computers?"

"Second floor" [check these against the real library]

Jeremy turned and ran to the stairs and down the two flights to the second floor.  He immediately saw the computer carels to his left and ran to an empty one.

He brought up a search engine in the browser and searched for Sacramento Bee.  He found the link and clicked it.

The Bee's web site had a search box.  Jeremy typed "jason's computers little league championship".  The search engine showed four articles.

Jason clicked the link for the first article.  It was a report of the championship game for 2007.  Jason's had taken the East Sacramento championship for the second year in a row.

The second article announced the upcoming game.  The third described the semifinal game in which Jason's had beaten Hoagie's Gyros to advance to the finals.  The fourth article listed the final standings for the regular season, and named the teams who would be playing in the semifinals.

All of the articles were from 2007.  Nothing from 2006.

Jeremy tried another search:  "jason's computers 2006".  The search engine found no matches.

"Shit," he said under his breath.

A hand touched Jeremy's shoulder and he jumped.  It was will.

"Try the advanced search," Will said.

"Jesus, don't sneak up on me like that!  I'm wearing my only clean shorts."

Will smiled and pointed at the screen.  "Advanced search.  Upper right corner."

Jeremy clicked the link for the advanced search.  There was a box for the keywords to search for, and a date range.  In the keyword box he typed "jason's computers little league championship".  He selected August 15 through August 31 as the range of dates and pressed the enter key.

No matches.

"Try a general search engine,' Will suggested.

Jeremy brought up Google and typed "east sacramento little league championship 2006" in the search box.  He pressed the enter key.

Google reported 32,592 matches and displayed the titles and excerpts for the first ten.  Jeremy scanned the displayed results.  Each excerpt included a few of the keywords he had searched for, but none was about his championship game.  He clicked the link for page two of the results and scanned the matches.

There it was!  "Jason's Takes East Sac Championship."  The displayed URL was on the Sacramento Bee's web site.  The excerpt showed the head of the article.  It was just as Jeremy had remembered it.  [Get opening from earlier scene.]

Jeremy's heart pounded.  He took a deep breath.  He felt Will's hand touch his shoulder, and he turned to see will holding up his other hand with his fingers crossed.

Jeremy clicked the link.

The browser displayed a white background on which was printed a single short line of text.

"Error 404 Page not found HTML v1.1"

"No!" Jeremy shouted.  He smacked the side of the monitor with his hand, twisting the monitor leftward.

"Whoa--" Will said, reaching tentatively toward Jeremy.

Jeremy jumped back.  "Don't you whoa me.  What's going on here?  First the newspaper is missing, then there's no fish, and now that exact page just happens to be missing from the Bee's web site.  What the hell is this?  I just want to see the Goddamned story!"

"Listen," Will said, "we can--"

"Where is the closest library to this one?"

"There's one on H Street.  Let me call and--"

Jeremy turned and ran in the direction of the stairs.  "What the hell is--"

As he passed the end of the row of computers, a man stepped into his path.  They crashed, sending the man stumbling backward a few feet.

"Sorry!" Jeremy shouted.  "I'm in a--"

Jeremy saw the man's face.

The old man from the park!

Surprised, Jeremy twisted to look at the man, but his momentum was carrying him toward the stairwell.  His feet tangled and he fell, still staring at the man.

The man moved toward him, extending a hand as if to help Jeremy to his feet.

"Stay away from me!" Jeremy shouted, scrambling away from the man.  He jumped to his feet and stared at the man.

This couldn't be mere coincidence.

Will shouted, "Jeremy!"

Jeremy turned.

"The Sacramento Bee.  Their office is on Broadway near 23rd.  They'll have a copy somewhere."

Yes!  "Thank you, Will!"

Jeremy turned to the old man, wondering whether to confront him now.

No time!

Jeremy turned and ran.

As he reached the top of the stairs, he heard the old man's voice behind him, saying "Jeremy" to himself, softly, as if it were a revelation.
