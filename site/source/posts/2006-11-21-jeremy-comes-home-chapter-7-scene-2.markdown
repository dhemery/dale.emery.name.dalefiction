Gil hesitated, not sure he wanted to know what was at the other end of this telephone number.  His family was in enough turmoil right now.  Two strangers had destroyed the fragile equilibrium the family had maintained for over a year.

If the phone number was bogus, Gil would simply hang up, catch his breath, and get on with his life.

But if this really was Aaron's number...  Then Gil didn't know what to think.  He didn't know what he would do.  Perhaps the family (<u>my mother</u>) could not stand an additional shock right now, even a good one.  And who was to say that finding Aaron would be a good thing?

But he had to know.  Foley and that Jeremy kid had said crazy things.  But they each knew things they had no way to know.  No rational way to know.

Gil had to know.

He pushed the final digit and held the phone to his ear.

At the other end of the call, someone answered the phone.

"Hello?"

Gil wasn't sure he recognized the voice.  It could  Aaron.  Aaron had been fifteen years old--the age Gil was now--the last time Gil had heard his voice.  Could that old man have been telling the truth?

"Is this Aaron Crowther?"

"Who's calling, please?"

"Your brother."

"Jesus!"

Gil had not known what to expect, but he had not expected the panic he heard in his brother's voice.

"Sorry to surprise you like this."

"Gil?  Is that you?"

"How many brothers you got?"

"Jesus."

"You said that already."

"How did you get my number?"

"You don't sound happy to hear from me."

"I--  It's kind of out of the blue, Gil."

"Well, you didn't leave a forwarding address."

"Jesus.  How did you--  How is Mom?"

"She's a basket case, same as always.  Especially--"

"Especially what?"  Aaron sounded alarmed again.

"Nothing.  A few bad days is all."

"Well, I'm not surprised to hear that.  And how is--"

"Nadine is fine.  She was asking about you today.  I didn't know what to tell her.  What should I tell her?"

"Tell her whatever you want, Gil."

Jesus, that's cold!  "Tell her whatever I want?  What the fuck is that?"

"I'm--  I'm kind of at a loss here, Gil.  I don't know what to say to you."

"How about, 'It's nice to hear from you?'"

Gil heard silence on the line.

"Was it a mistake for me to call you, Aaron?"

"What?  No, no.  Just a shock that's all."

"There's a lot of that going around lately."

"Wha--"

"Nothing.  Listen, I--"

"Gil, I want to ask you something.  I know I have no right--"

"You got that right."

Aaron paused.  "How did you get my number?  I'm sorry to ask it that way, but it's important to me."

"Jesus, Aaron, we don't hear word one from you for six years and the first thing you want to know is how I got your number?"

"You're right, Gil, you're right."  Aaron's voice sounded strained again.  "But I did ask about the family first."

Yes, that was true.  Maybe Gil was being harsh.  After all, he had called Aaron out of the blue.  It must be a shock for Aaron, too.  Six years is a long time.  How do you reconnect after five years?

"Some guy came here.  He said he'd been talking to you."

"What guy!" Aaron shouted.  "Jesus, Gil, what guy?"

What the hell?

"Hey, stop yelling at me!"

"Jesus.  Gil, I'm sorry.  What guy?"

Gil looked at the card that he had taken from Nadine.  "Page Foley."

"Page Foley!"  Aaron sounded absolutely apoplectic now.  "Jesus, Gil.  What did he say?"

"Who is this Foley guy, Aaron?"

"I don't know."

"You don't know him?"

"Gil, Foley is crazy.  He's--  Whatever he said, don't listen to him.  He told me some crazy shit.  Jesus, Gil, he's crazy, don't listen to--"

"What does he want with us?"

"I don't know, Gil, but I'm sorry he's bothering you.  I'll put a stop to it, I promise."

"Aaron, what--"

"Gil, please listen.  I have to go.  I have to stop this guy Foley.  If he comes back, whatever you do, do not listen to him.  He's crazy.  He's crazy.  Do not listen to him.  Okay?"

"Aaron, who is--"

"Do not listen to him!  Do you hear me?"

"Okay, okay!"

"And don't let him anywhere near Mom or Deena."

Jesus!  "Dee--"

Click.

Deena!  Aaron had called his sister Deena!  What the hell was going on?
