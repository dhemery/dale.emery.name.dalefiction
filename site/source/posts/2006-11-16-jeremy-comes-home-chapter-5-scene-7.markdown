Terry Mortenson stepped onto the doorstep at 4212 Fortin Street and pushed the button for the doorbell.  He looked at his watch.  2:33 in the afternoon.  He looked around to see if anyone else was in the streets, anyone who might see him.

He took a pack of Marlboros from his shirt pocket, tapped a cigarette from the pack, and lit it.

After a moment he pushed the doorbell button again.  He put his ear to the door and listened.

Not a sound.

Terry looked at his watch again.  2:35.

Shit!
