Erika Howard woke up screaming, again, and in labor, again.

Tom, the nurse, said, "Uh oh..."

Erika said, "I thought you weren't supposed to say 'uh oh' in an operating room."

"It looks as if we're going to have to do this all over again," said Doctor Obvious.

"Any chance we can take the fast lane this time, doc?"

"The fast lane?"

"Grab your butcher knife and go in after him," Erika said.  "I mean, I love the kid and all, but I don't think I want to go through labor three times for him."

"I have a hunch," said Doctor Morris, "that this won't be the last time."

"Oh, don't you tell me that, you son of a bitch."  Erika propped herself up on her elbows and shook her head decisively from side to side.  "Don't you fucking tell me that."
