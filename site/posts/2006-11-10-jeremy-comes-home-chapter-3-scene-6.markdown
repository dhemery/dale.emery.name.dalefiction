<em>NOTE:  I decided that Jeremy goes to another library after all, not to the offices of the Sacramento Bee.</em>

Out of breath, Jeremy burst through the door of the McKinley Park Library with such force that it banged against the wall, causing one patron to drop the magazine she was reading and place a hand on her chest.

The information desk was straight ahead.  Behind it sat a slender black woman with large black-rimmed glasses.  Or, she had been sitting.  She was now rising and looking straight at Jeremy.

Jeremy ran toward the desk and the woman.  "Where are the--"

"You must be Jeremy," the woman said.  "Mister Walker called ahead and told me to take care of--"

"Who is Mister Walker?" Jeremy puffed between ragged breaths.

"William Walker.  He was trying to help you at--"

"Do you have the newspaper?"

"No, but--"

"Then why the hell did Will send me all the way over here?"

"My guess is that you didn't give him much chance to think.  But--"

"Is there another library?"

"Listen, Jeremy," the librarian said.  "Are you going to give me a minute to figure out how to help you, or would you prefer that I send you running halfway across Sacramento on another wild goose chase?"

"God!" Jeremy said, raising a hand and placing it on the back of his head.  He turned and looked around him.  There were only three other people that he could see, including the woman he had startled earlier.  She gripped the now rolled up magazine tightly in both hands and looking at Jeremy with her eyes wide and her mouth in an O.

Jeremy felt a rush of embarrassment.

"Jeez, lady, I'm sorry."

The woman's mouth slammed shut and she spun away from Jeremy and stepped stiffly behind a shelf.

"Jeremy," the librarian said.  "Why don't you tell me what you are looking for."

"Yeah.  Okay, yeah."  Jeremy's breathing had nearly returned to normal now.  "I'm looking for a story that ran in the Sacramento Bee on August 20, 2006.  Page D7, I think.  The sports section.  It's a story about my team winning the little league championship."

"This is about a little league championship?"

"It's important," Jeremy insisted.  "It's kind of hard to explain.  Do you have it or not?"

The librarian stiffened.

Jeremy held up his hands in a warding off gesture.  "Sorry.  Honest, lady.  I'm having a real bad day.  I'm sorry."

"I can help," she said.

Jeremy felt a rush of hope, followed by a wave of trepidation.  Did he want to find that article, or didn't he?

"Please.  I'd appreciate that.  I can't tell you how much I'd appreciate that."

"Do you have a library card?"

"No, I don't have a library card!"

"Okay, okay.  We'll use mine.  Our web site has a complete archive of the Bee since 1980.  You just need a library card to access it."

"What?  It's all online?"  Jeremy felt drained.  "Why didn't Will tell me that?"

"Maybe he didn't know.  I think he's a volunteer, and a new one at that."

Jeremy felt the tears start to come.

"I don't mean to push, but can we take a look now?"

The librarian led Jeremy to a table on which sat four computers.  She sat in the chair and Jeremy stood beside her as she brought up the Sacramento Public Library web site.

There on the front page was a link labeled "newspapers."

She clicked it, and the browser displayed a page of newspaper titles.  The first was Sacramento Bee.  She clicked it.

"What was that date?"

"August 20, last year.  2006."

She typed the date into a box on the screen.  "What would you like me to search for?"

"Jason's takes east sac championship," Jeremy said.  "I think that was the headline."

The librarian typed the words and pressed the enter key.

A new page appeared on the screen.  At the top of the page was the headline, "Jason's Takes East Sac Championship."

Jeremy made a sound that was not a word, but more of a squeak.  Finally!  Finally the proof he was looking for.

He read the first paragraph, a single sentence.  "Jason's Computers squeaked past rival Fed Ex Kinko's to win the East Sacramento Little League championship yesterday."

"Is this what you were looking for?" the librarian asked.

"Yes!  Thank you!  Yes!  My God, this is it!"

Jeremy read the second paragraph.

"The game was capped by a stunning double play turned by mild mannered third baseman Christian Cavezos in the bottom of the ..."

Suddenly Jeremy could not see.  His vision blurred and he felt dizzy.

In a tiny voice he whispered, "No..."

He barely heard the librarian's concerned voice as she said, "Jeremy?"

Jeremy noticed that his hands hands were shaking.  Then he noticed that he was whimpering.  Then he noticed that he was trembling.

Then a horrible sound filled his ears, and no matter how hard he tried, Jeremy found that he could not stop screaming.
