Foley drove the rented Ford Aspire slowly down Yamhill Street looking for number 1401, the address Aaron had given him, a coffee shop.  On either side of the street were small shops.

There it was on the corner.  Number 1401 Yamhill Street was a coffee shop called The Friendly Roast.  Foley pulled into an empty parking space two stores down.

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    Aaron hadn't mentioned that the address was a coffee shop.</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff">    Foley entered The Friendly Roast and looked around.  The smell of coffee was surprisingly mild.  Foley had come to detest coffee shops that overwhelmed the senses with flavors designed to shock and awe.  In The Friendly Roast, tasteful art that adorned the walls, each item identified and priced on a small tag placed discretely beneath, appeared to be from only two artists.  One set were farm scenes sketched in oil pencils, with unusual colors so that each scene appeared to be a negative.  The other set were abstract images, each made from scraps of paper of a variety of shapes, colors, and textures.</font>

<font color="#3366ff"><font color="#3366ff"><strike>    According to Jeremy, Aaron would be twenty one years old now.  There were several young men of approximately the right age in the coffee shop, each engaged in conversation with two or three other young people.  None of the patrons seemed to notice him.</strike></font></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><font color="#3366ff"><strike>    Foley stood near the door and looked around in an exaggeratedly expectant way, hoping to attract Aaron's attention.  Nobody in the shop was alone.  Nobody seemed to notice him.</strike></font></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><font color="#3366ff"><strike>    Foley stepped out the door and looked up and down the street.</strike></font></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><font color="#3366ff">[NOTE:  I realized here that Aaron and Foley couldn't have pre-arranged a specific time to meet.  For one thing, Foley had hid the fact that he was already on his way.  For another, it's a 500 mile drive from Sacramento to Portland, and not subject to to-the-minute planning.  So it didn't make sense for Foley to expect Aaron to be here already.  D'oh!]</font></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><font color="#3366ff">    "Call me when you get there," Aaron had said.</font></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><font color="#3366ff">    Foley ordered a sixteen ounce black coffee.</font></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><font color="#3366ff">    Two doors gave entrance to The Friendly Roast, one entering from Yamhill Street and the other from Fourteenth Street.  Foley found an empty table that provided a good view of each door.</font></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><font color="#3366ff">    He dialed Aaron's telephone number.</font></font>
