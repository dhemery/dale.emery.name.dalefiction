<em>NOTE:  I had thought that the previous scene and this one were superfluous, but I wanted to write them because I need the word count.  Then as I sat down at Borders to finish the scene (starting with "Tell me what happened"), I realized how the scene had to end.  I had planned for Gil to give the same information, but I hadn't noticed what the information would mean to the person he's giving it to.  And, voila, suddenly a new scene (that I had not thought of before) becomes inevitable, and pretty darned soon.  I wish I could say I planned this all out deliberately, but I'm nowhere near as smart as my subconscious.</em>

Patty's arm bumped her coffee cup as reached for the telephone.  For a surreal moment she watched the coffee slosh in slow motion.  It did not spill.

A good omen, she thought.

She picked up the phone and pressed the button for line three.  "Mister Crowther, my name is Patricia Yonce.  Did you say that a Page Foley appeared at your house?"

"Yes, ma'am.  Last night around seven o'clock."

Seven o'clock?  "Are you sure that was the time?"

"I think so.  My sister and I were eating dinner."

Jeremy had called from Redding at nine o'clock.  There was no way Foley could have made it to Redding in two hours, not without attracting a great deal of attention.  So maybe Jeremy had told the truth.  Maybe Foley was not with him.

"Tell me what happened."

"He said he wanted to see my mother.  To talk about Aaron.  He said he knew where Aaron was."

"Aaron..."  The name tugged at Patty.  Then she remembered.  Jeremy had mentioned the name.  Aaron, he said, was a brother who had run away in 2001.  Could it be?

"My brother.  He left a few years ago."

How could Jeremy have known that?  He would have had to study the Crowthers.  Either that or...

Or Foley had studied them.

"Okay.  What else did he say?"

"Nothing.  I slammed the door in his face.  I was still mad because of that kid."

"The boy who came to the house the other day?  The one who called himself Jeremy?"

"Yes.  I think they're all together in this."

Patty felt a prickle on her neck.  Not "both" but "all."  How many people was he talking about?

"All together in... what?"

"I don't know!" Gil shouted.  "But they know things they shouldn't know.  I think they're bugging the house."

"What makes you think that?"

"Because they all knew what Nadine and I were talking about."

"Things you said in private?"

"Yes.  We were eating dinner.  Nadine said she wanted a nickname.  She wanted me to call her Deena.  We were talking about that when Foley came."

"And he knew about her nickname."

"Yes.  It scared the hell out of me.  Sorry for swearing."

"That's okay, Gil."

"He said, 'You must be Deena.'  How could he know unless he was listening somehow?"

"We will come and check that out, Gil.  Are you sure she never used that name before?  You never heard her say 'Deena' before?"

"No, but she said that kid called her Deena."

"The boy who came to your house?"

"Yeah, that Jeremy kid."

"But that was... four days ago.  How could--"

"No, I--"  Gil grunted in frustration.  "What I mean is that Nadine heard the kid say Deena last Thursday.  Then yesterday she decided that she wants to call herself Deena.  But Foley knew, too.  Yesterday.  I'm sorry, I'm explaining it backwards."

"That's okay.  I think I'm following you.  Gil, if what you say is right, then I wouldn't worry about being spied on.  It's more likely that Mister Foley and the boy talked about Nadine before Foley came to your house."

"That's what I was thinking.  But that means they're in on it together, right?"

"You have a good, analytical mind, Gil.  We don't know what they're up to, but we do know that they're connected somehow."

"Holy... mackerel."

"I'm glad you called, Gil.  We've been--"

"But that means Aaron is in on it, too, doesn't it?"

"What?"

"Aaron called her Deena, too."

"You--  You talked to Aaron?"

"Yes, I called him last night, right after Foley left."

"And your brother knew about Nadine's nickname?"

"Yes.  How could he know unless they're all...  How could he know?"

"That's a very good question.  You said you called Aaron?  Do you have his telephone number?"

"Yes, Foley gave it to me.  He dropped it through the mail slot."

"You're sure it was Aaron?"

"Pretty sure.  It's been a long time.  It sounded like him.  What I guess he would sound like."

"I'd like to talk to him.  Can you give me his number?"

"Yeah, Foley wrote it down.  You want Foley's number, too?"

"Foley--  Mister Foley gave you his own telephone number?"

"He wrote them both on a card."

"Yes, I'd like both numbers please."

Gil read the numbers to her.  First Aaron's, then Foley's.

Patty stared at Foley's number.  It seemed familiar.  Had she looked it up before visiting him, or before requesting the search warrant?  She didn't remember doing that.

Then where--

Even before she recognized the number she felt the skin of her cheeks and her forehead tingle.  It was Terry's cell phone number.  What was Foley doing with Terry's phone number?  And why was Foley giving it out as his own?

Dear God.  What the hell was going on?

"Gil, you've been very helpful.  Very helpful.  Is there anything else you can think of?  Anything else at all?"

A pause, then, "No.  I think that's everything."

"Thank you very much, Gil.  If you think of anything else, or if you hear from Aaron, Foley, or the boy, please contact me immediately."  She gave Gil her personal cell phone number and hung up.

What the hell was Terry doing mixed up in all of this?
