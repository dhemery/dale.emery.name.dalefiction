I've posted Chapter 1, Scene 1.

Sixteen of us started writing at midnight in the back room at Java California in Dixon.  We had "reserved" the room for two hours, and most of us stayed and wrote until 2am.

I finished my first scene exactly at 2am.  I'm delighted with what I wrote (though I probably can't trust my judgment at 3:45am).  And my word count is 1504, which is just about my usual for a two-hour session.

A bunch of us will meet tonight from 7â€“9pm at a local coffee shop for the first of our weekly Thursday night write-ins.  I expect that my next scene will take the full two hours and net another 1500 words or so.  We'll see.

So far, so good!

Still no sign of a plot...
