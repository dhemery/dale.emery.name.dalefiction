The door swung open and there, yawning and rubbing his eyes awake, stood Terry in old boxer shorts.  "Patty, what are--"

Patty rushed in and slammed the door.  Through clenched teeth she said, "I'm going to ask you a question, and the next thing I hear from you had better be a damned good explanation or so help me I will smack you."

Terry stepped back, his eyes wide.  Then he smiled and said, "Hey, I like the sound of--"

Patty belted him, hard and full fisted, across the chin.

Terry crumpled to the gritty linoleum floor and hit his head against the leg of the cheap dinette table.

"Patty, what the fuck--"

"Why does Page Foley have your cell phone?"

Terry shrank back as he realized what this was about.  He was fully awake and his eyes shuttled from Patty's face to her fisted hands and back again.  "It fell out of my pocket."

"While you were doing what?"  Patty pronounced each word as if it were a separate sentence.

Terry's mouth opened and closed and made sounds that were not words.

Patty leaned over him.  "Just.  Fucking.  Say it."

Terry brought his arm up to ward off whatever Patty might do to him.  "I was telling the Crowther kid that his brother wanted to see him."

Patty stood upright and turned her back to Terry.  She put the balls of her fists to her eyes and growled wordlessly.

She heard the table leg scrape the floor behind her.  "Stay down," she said without turning, without taking her hands from here eyes.

The scraping stopped.

Patty took a deep breath and ran her palms down the sides of her hips.  She held the breath for a moment, then let it out with a loud <u>puh</u>.

She turned around.  Terry rested--but that wasn't the right word--on his elbows and looked up at her, fully alert.

She nodded to a chair.  Terry looked doubtfully at the chair, then back at Patty.

"Get up," she said.  "and sit.  We're going to have a little talk."
