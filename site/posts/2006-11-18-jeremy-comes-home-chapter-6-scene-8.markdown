The door opened and a teenage boy looked out.  This was the brother that Jeremy had fought on Friday.  Gil.  "Yes?"

"Is your mother home?"

Gil regarded Foley.  "What do you want?"

"I'd like to talk to your mother.  You're Gil, right?"

Gil's face went rigid.  "And who are you?"

"My name is Page Foley.  Please, is your mother home?  It's important."

"What's this about?"

Jesus, why did every little thing have to be so hard?  "It's about your brother."  Foley noticed the ambiguity, and quickly added, "Aaron."

Gil jerked back in surprise.  "Aaron?  What about him?"

"Please," Foley pleaded.  Is your mother ome?"

"Listen, Mister, you can tell me what you want or you can leave.  What's it going to be?"

"Gil, please--"

"Have it your way."  Gil stepped back and started to close the door.

Foley threw his hand out to stop the door from closing.  "Okay, wait..."

Gil stopped.  He looked at Foley's hand on the door, then at Foley.  Slowly and deliberately he said, "Mister, this would be a
really good time to take your hand away from the door."

Foley removed his hand from the door and stepped back.  "Gil, I--"

Gil began again to swing the door closed.

Foley blurted, "I know where Aaron is!"

Gil stopped and opened the door.  Behind him a girl stepped into view.

The girl said, "Where is Aaron?"

Foley said, "You must be Deena."

Gil and Deena looked at each other and stared.  Gil frowned.  Deena beamed.

Foley continued.  "Gil, I know where--"

Gil interrupted.  "What did you just say?"

Jesus.  How many times did he have to say it?  "I know where Aaron--"

"Not that.  What did you call her?"

Foley was puzzled.  Wasn't her name Deena?  "Isn't she Deena?"

Deena grinned and curtseyed to Foley.  "My name is Deena.  Pleased to meet you."

Foley felt dizzy.  What the hell was going on?  "I'm..." he stammered.  "My..."

"How the hell did you know that?" Gil demanded.  He suddenly reached out and grabbed Foley by the collar.  "How did you know that, old man?"

"I--  I'm sorry," Foley said.  "Isn't that her name?  She just said her name is--"

Gil cut him off.  "Answer my fucking question.  How did you know her name?"

Foley opened his mouth to say Jeremy's name, but he caught himself.  As far as Gil knew, Jeremy was not his brother, but some insane kid who was making wild claims.

"Your brother."  This time Foley used the ambiguity in his favor, or so he hoped.  "Your brother said her name."

"You talked to Aaron?"

"Yes.  I talked to him a few minutes ago."

Gil looked out the door and down the street.

"He's not here."  My God, Foley thought.  How the hell do two people ever communicate anything?  "I talked to him on the phone."

"Aaron said his sister's name is Deena?  How the fuck did <u>he</u> know?"

Deena said, "My name <u>is</u> Deena."

Gil turned and snapped, "Nadine, shut up."

"I'm <u>Deena!</u>" Deena said.

What the hell was going on?  "But..."

"But nothing.  How did Aaron know?"

Foley looked at Deena, pleading with his eyes.  But <u>she</u> said her name was Deena.  Jesus, now he was looking to a ten year old girl to help him talk.

Foley raised a hand to his head and could think of nothing to say.

"What the hell are you people doing?  Why are you fucking with my family?"

You people?  What--  Oh, Jesus.  Gil was referring to Jeremy.  Foley could not admit that.  "I don't know--"

"You're in this with that Jeremy kid, aren't you?

Foley jerked in surprise at the sound of Jeremy's name, "I don't--"

"I <u>knew</u> it," Gil said.  He turned to Deena.  "Nadine, call 911 right now.  Tell them there's a man named Foley bothering us."

"Deena!" Deena shouted.

"Oh, for Christ's sake Na-- Deena."

Foley said, "Gil, no, wait.  I know where Aaron is."

Gil pointed a finger at Foley.  "You," hel said through gritted teeth, sounding for all the world like Clint Eastwood, "do not want to fuck with me.  If I see you or that simple fuck Jeremy again, you're both dead.  Do you hear me?"

The door slammed in Foley's face.
