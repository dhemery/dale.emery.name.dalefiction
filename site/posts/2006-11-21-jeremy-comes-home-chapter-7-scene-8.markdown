It was not like Gil to hesitate.  And yet he hesitated.  He spent a sleepless night trying to make sense of these strange happenings.  A strange boy who had intruded on his family, claiming to be his brother.  A strange man who claimed to know where his brother Aaron was.  And a brother who had remained aloof from the family, suddenly turning up--and that only involuntarily--at the same time as these two strangers.

Stranger still was the connection among these three people.  They all seemed to think of Nadine as Deena.

Why the fuck did they think of Nadine at all?  The man and the boy had no legitimate reason.

Nadine had chosen her nickname only after that fucking boy had called her Deena.  And then the old man had called her Deena.  And the old man's information about Aaron had been true.  And then Aaron had called Nadine Deena.

How could that be?

The only way any of this made sense is if they were all in it together.  But in <u>what</u> together?  What the hell were they up to?  And why?

After a long night of conclusionless conclusions, explanations that explained nothing, Gil had decided that explanations and conclusions did not matter.  Whatever these three were up to, it was disrupting his family, a family that, as it was, lived just barely within the borders of sanity.

It was not like Gil to hesitate, and yet it was not decisiveness but weariness that led him to a decision.  He did not wish to struggle any longer to explain what was happening.

Gil picked up the phone and called the police.

"I want to report..."  What did he want to report?  "I want to some strange happenings."

Strange happenings!  Fuck.  Gil was more weary than he'd thought.

"Who is calling, please."

"Gil Crowther.  Virgil Crowther."

"What sort of strange happenings, Mister Crowther?"

"A man has been bothering my family.  He came to my house."

"Is he there now?"

"No.  Yesterday."

"Do you know the man?"

"No, I never saw him before."

"Can you describe him?"

"An old guy.  Maybe sixty or seventy.  He said his name was Page Foley."

"Did you say, 'Foley?'"

"Yes, sir.  Page Foley."

Gil heard the clicking of a computer keyboard.  "And your name is Crowther?"

"Yes, sir."

"Seventy-two Cherry Street?"

"Yes."

"Mister Crowther, can you hold on please?"

Before Gil could answer, the police receptionist was gone, and Gil heard a musak version of "The Night They Drove Ole Dixie Down."

<em>NOTE:  Okay, I wrote another paragraph or two, then decided that the rest of this scene needs to be in somebody else's point of view (I'll bet you can guess whose).  Switching points of view means that what will follow is not the rest of this scene, but a whole new scene.  A whole new scene of yack yack yack on the phone.</em>

<em>Bleah.</em>

<em>Hmmm...  I notice that nobody has died yet...
