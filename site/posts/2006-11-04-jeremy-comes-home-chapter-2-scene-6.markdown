The sky had brightened into full morning by the time Jeremy stopped in front of Ronald Ferrar Elementary school.  He had walked around the neighborhood for an hour to warm himself against the chill of the dawn twilight.

He was surprised that the sight of the school brought strong memories.  Not images so much as a confusing mix of feelings.  He had attended school here for a little more than five years.  It was here that he had learned that he was a pretty smart kid.  He did well on his homework and on his tests with little effort.  And in standardized tests he always scored first or second in his crowded class.

And it was here that he had learned that other kids were happier than he was, that not everybody's mother spent her days in bed trying to shut out the world.  It was here that he had learned that every other family but his own was cheerful and happy and warm.

And it was here that he had decided that as smart as he was, he was not smart enough to fix his family.

He was certainly not smart enough to bring his father back.  And he was not sure he wanted to.  Howard had left shortly after 9/11, saying that life was too short to live it in misery.  So he had packed his things and moved to New York with a woman that (according to Mom) he had been "fooling around with" for years.  Jeremy was not sure he would ever stop resenting his father for what he had done to his mother.  And as hard as his mother had cried in the months after Howard left, Jeremy was not sure she could ever forgive him either.  Even now, six years later, Natalie still reserved her rare displays of emotion for bursts of curses about "that bastard."

Jeremy hated her outbursts.  But they were far rarer now, and that was scarier still.  Her deadness was scarier still.

But that came later.  At first it was all vitriol.

Aaron had bailed out early, less than a year after Howard left.  He couldn't take Natalie's constant complaints, and constant attempts to drag him into the fight.  "Don't you think that's an awful thing to do?" she would say.

So Aaron had left for God knows where.  No parting words.  No note.  He had left mom an empty wallet, which for a week had given her something to complain about other than "that asshole father of yours."

After Aaron left, Natalie had slowly, almost imperceptibly, begun to fade out of the world.

Gil was relieved.  "It's about fucking time," he said.  "Dad was an asshole, and it's time she accepted that."  He did not make any connection between Natalie's change in attitude and Aaron's running away.  Gil rarely mentioned Aaron.

One evening, about a year after Aaron had left, Jeremy had been sitting with Gil at the kitchen table, each doing their homework.  Jeremy said, "Do you ever think about Aaron?"

Gil looked at Jeremy for a long time, his eyes blazing, jaw muscles clenched, and cheeks reddening.  He did not speak.  Finally he gathered up his books and papers and walked out of the room.

Jeremy had never asked Gil about Aaron again.  And Gil never brought him up.

Jeremy had watched in increasing sadness and guilt as his mother slid into bleakness.  He was smart, dammit, and he didn't know what to do.  He had always been the one to cheer her up, and now he didn't know what to do.

Only Deena had seemed immune to the invisible gasses that were slowly dissolving her family.  Maybe she was too young to understand what was going on.  Maybe she didn't remember the family that was now all but gone.  Or maybe she was wise in a way that Jeremy was not.

Now Jeremy remembered walking with Deena too and from this school every day.  For three years they had walked together, she always chatty and bright, he always amused and thoughtful.

Jeremy remembered those walks as he paced back and forth along the sidewalk across the street from the school.  He kept an eye on the corner where Deena would come.

He didn't know if Deena would be coming alone.  She was old enough now to walk herself to school.  But after the events of yesterday, he feared that Natalie would want to walk Deena to school.  If that happened, Jeremy would leave.

Jeremy also kept an eye out for the police.  Had his mother really called the police?  Would she demand that they monitor the school looking for the boy who had disrupted her family?

Jeremy was prepared to leave.  Prepared to run.

Cars drove past.  More and more turned into the school driveway and on to the parking lot in the rear.  Moms (always moms, never dads) drove up to drop off a child or two.  Children began to appear in twos and threes on the sidewalk, talking happily as they marched toward the school.

And then Jeremy saw Deena.  She was not alone.  Walking a few paces behind her was Gil.  Jeremy had not seen Gil in a year, and he was taller now, with longer hair.

Jeremy had been so worried about his mother and the police that he hadn't considered that Gil might come.

Jeremy raised his arm and waved.  "Hey!  Hey Gil, hey Deena."  He began to walk across the street toward them, but could not help hiimself and broke into a run.

Deena clutched her books and turned to Gil.  She pointed toward Jeremy and said, "That's him.  That's the one."

Gil dropped his books and strode toward Jeremy.  As he moved he turned toward Deena and said, "You wait there.  Don't move."

Jeremy stopped.  The look on Gil's face was the same as when Jeremy had last asked him arout Aaron.  Intense.

Gil was two steps away now.

"Wait," Jeremy said, raising his hands.

Gil swung his right hand fiercely and smashed Jeremy in the side of the head.

Blinded, Jeremy fell to the grass beside the sidewalk.  "Wait!" he shouted.  He put a hand to the ground to push himself up.

Gil hit Jeremy again, a blow on the shoulder that knocked him flat on his back.

"Gil, stop!" Jeremy shouted.  "Gil, please!"  He blinked and his vision returned, blurry.

Gil stood over him, pointing a finger into Jeremy's face.  "You leave my family alone!"

"Gil, I <u>am</u> your family.  It's me, Jeremy!"

"Leave my family alone.  Do you hear me, or am I going to have to get your fucking attention again?"

Jeremy raised a hand in surrender.  "Wait, I can prove it.  I can prove--"

Gil kicked Jeremy in the arm, knocking him back on the grass.

Jeremy scrambled away, his arm throbbing.  "All right, all right.  Hold on."

Gil was looking to where he had left Deena standing.  His chest rose and fell rapidly.

Jeremy yelled, "We burned your Pedro Martinez card!"

Gil looked back at Jeremy, puzzled, as if he weren't sure he had heard what he thought he heard.  "What?"

Jeremy repeated.  "After Pedro punched Don Zimmer in that baseball game in 2003, we burned his baseball card.  You said you couldn't respect a man who hit someone weaker than him.  So you got out your Pedro baseball card, and I held it, and you burned a hole in it with a match.  Then we hid it behind the loose baseboard in our bedroom, the little short one between the closet and the door."

Gil stared for a moment, his mouth open.  "How did you know about that?  I never told anyone about that."

"I was there," Jeremy said.  "I'm your brother.  I was--"

"My brother is twenty fucking years old!"

"No, not Aaron.  Jeremy!  Your <u>little</u> brother!"

"I don't have a little brother, you fucking idiot."

<u>Jesus</u>, Jeremy thought.  <u>Not again.</u>  "But what about the Pedro card?  The baseboard?  How did I know that, then?"

Gil suddenly reached down, grabbed Jeremy's jacket, and jerked him to his feet.  "Jesus Christ, you've been in our house!"

Jeremy could take the pain no longer.  He burst into tears.  "Gil, Gil, what's going on?  My God, what is going on?"

Gil threw Jeremy to the ground.  "You fucking stay away from my family.  We've been through enough.  Do you hear me?"

"I know, Gil.  Dad left, and Aaron left.  I was there Gil.  I was there!"

Suddenly Gil burst into tears and pointed at Jeremy.  "If I see you again, I'll put you in the hospital."

Jeremy's head swam.  "Gil..."

"And you leave my mother alone.  She's been through hell and she doesn't deserve this.  If you bother her again, I will kill you.  Don't think I won't do it."

"Gil, stop saying that."

"And if you come near Nadine, I swear to God I will fucking cut you, and I will burn you, and I will torture you in every way I can think of.  I swear to God.  And then I will kill you.  Don't you doubt me."

Jeremy stared up at his brother in shock.  "I love you," he said, the words surprising him.  He had not said those words to anyone in years.

Gil kicked Jeremy in the chest, knocking Jeremy's breath away.  Deena screamed.

Jeremy struggled to breathe and could not.

"Don't you fucking doubt me," Gil said, and walked away toward Deena, leaving Jeremy either to find his breath or not.
