"Is she gone?" Jeremy said.

"She drove away.  I don't see the cruiser any more."

"There's no way I'm going with you to the police station."

"No?"

"No way.  They must know by now that your story was bogus."

"That's a problem for me, not for you."

"Uh, I don't think so.  What do you think they'd do with a kid who has no family and no identification, and is hanging around with old men who aren't related to him?"

"They'd probably get you some help."

"Oh?  And just what kind of help do you think I need?"

"Food and shelter, for a start."

"I can take care of my own food and shelter."

"A family, then."

"I have a family."

Foley raised an eyebrow.

Jeremy said, "They'll throw me in some program and put me in some foster home with some mercinary parents who raise kids like they're raising goats."

"Well, what then?"

"I don't know."

What was he going to do?  Go back to the streets?  He could survive.  He didn't want to take that route, but he knew he could survive it.

Jeremy asked, "What are you going to do about your problem?  Your story was so full of holes I'm surprised they bought it even for a minute."

"I think the bought it because you went along with it.  You were pretty convincing."

"Well, I'd say they've seen through it now."

"I'd say so, too."

"So what are you going to do?"

"I'm going to run."

"What!"

"What do you think would happen if I showed up for Officer Yonce's 'paperwork?'"

"I think you'd tapdance for her some more--"

"Her and Andollo, probably."

"Okay.  They'd ask a lot of questions, and you'd tapdance.  And then they'd run out of questions and that would be that.  It's not like you've committed a crime."

"I'm not so sure about that.  I lied to the police."

"You weren't under oath."

"No, but they were condicting an investigation.  I don't know if that's a crime, but even so they aren't likely to take kindly to my fabrications.  They take child welfare pretty seriously."

"But if you didn't commit a crime--"

"Then they'll find one."

"Jesus, you're even more cynical than I am."

"Like I said, they take child welfare seriously.  I did what I did because I needed to talk to you, Jeremy.  I think you understand why.  But I think I'm in big trouble here."

"Jesus, Mister Foley."

"What are you going to do, Jeremy?"

"I don't know."

"Well, listen, I'm feeling a pressing need to get out of here.  I need to pack--"

"I'll go with you!"

"What?  No, Jeremy--"

"I'll go with you.  Why not?"

"I'm pretty sure kidnapping is a crime."

"But you wouldn't be kidnapping me."

"If they catch us, Jeremy, they will consider that a technicality."

"You need me!"

"What?"

"To help you figure out what happened to you fifty years ago.  You need me."

"Jeremy, I don't think--"

"Bullshit!  You followed me around for days, then you lied to the fucking police that you were my grandfather.  Those were stupid things to do, and you don't strike me as a stupid guy."

"Jeremy, I--"

"You must have wanting something pretty badly to pull a stunt like that.  Talking to me must have been pretty important to you."

Foley's eyes began to tear.  "Jeremy, I can't do that.  I think I've created enough trouble for you already."

"And what the fuck do you think I'm going to do on my own?"

"Jeremy, I don't think you need to use that language--"

"My family doesn't know who I am.  If I don't go with you, what the fuck do you think I'm going to do?  Live in the street?"

"You lived in the street bef--"

"You owe me!"

"What?"

"You owe me.  Before you burst into the police station with your stories, Andollo was just about to let me go.  He brought me food, and I was stuffing it into my backpack getting ready to go."

"Jeremy, I don't know what's going to happen.  I can't promise--"
<em>NOTE:  This scene contains what I sincerely hope is the stupidest line I have ever written.</em>

"I don't need any promises.  Just take me with you.  I need you."

To Jeremy's surprise, Foley burst out laughing.  "For God's sake, Jeremy, is there any string you won't pull?  Take pity on an old fool."

Jeremy folded his hands under his chin, tilted his head to one side, and looked up at Foley with the saddest puppy eyes he could muster.  "Please, Mister Foley?  Please won't you take me with you?"

Foley sighed dramatically.  "One condition," he said.
