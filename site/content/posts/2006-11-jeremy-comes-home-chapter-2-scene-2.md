- Jeremy Comes Home

---

Gordon Abbot High School was a two story white brick building surrounded by thick green grass in the Fabulous Forties, an upper middle class section of the eastern Sacramento suburbs.  Jeremy stood at the foot of a wide concrete stairway that led to a grassy terrace.  Every few minutes students came out of the building alone or in small groups and passed him without notice.

A bell rang, and immediately the pace of the exodus increased.  Jeremy moved back along the sidewalk, eastward in the direction of his house, so that he could see the individual students.  He recognized only a few of the students, and none by name.  These students were two years older than Jeremy, or older.  He didn’t see any of Gil’s friends.

After a few minutes, Jeremy decided not to wait for someone he knew by name.  A blonde girl emerged from the door dressed in faded black jeans and a yellow Dropkick Murphys T-shirt.  As she came nearer, Jeremy thought he recognized her.

“Excuse me.”

She stopped and raised her eyebrows, but said nothing.

“Do you know Gil Crowther?”

“Yeah, sure,” she said.

“Do you know where he is?”

“Not my day to keep track of sophomores,” she said curtly, and started to walk away.

Jeremy started to protest, and was interrupted by a voice from the stairs.

“Hey, Angie!”  A tall boy waved at the blonde girl and picked up his pace.

Angie stopped and turned back toward the tall boy.  She smiled.  “Hey, Doolie.”

Doolie closed the gap.  He smiled at Angie, then looked at Jeremy.  “Who’s this?” he said, poking his thumb in Jeremy’s direction.

Angie said, “I don’t know.  He’s asking about Gil.”

“Gil Crowther?”  Doolie regarded Jeremy again.  “What do you want with Gil?”

“He’s my brother,” said Jeremy.

“I didn’t know Gil had a little brother.”  Doolie turned to Angie.  “Did you?”

Angie shook her head.  “No.  I didn’t know him very well.”

Doolie turned to Jeremy.  “Gil only has one brother.”

Jeremy’s heart jumped.  Had <u>Aaron</u> come home, too?

“You know Aaron?”

“Yeah,” said Doolie.  “He was a few years ahead of me in middle school.”

<u>Was</u>, Jeremy thought.  Past tense.  Maybe it just meant that Doolie had changed schools.

Jeremy said, “Do you know where <u>Aaron</u> is now?”

Doolie frowned and looked at Angie, who shrugged.  Doolie squinted at Jeremy.  “I thought you said you were his brother.  What did you say your name was?”

“Jeremy.”

“Funny Gil never mentioned a brother named Jeremy,” Doolie said.

“Never men--”

“Listen, kid,” Doolie said, “I don’t know who you are, but you don’t want to fuck with Gil.  And you sure don’t want to fuck with him about Aaron.”

Doolie looked at Angie.  “What did this kid say to you, exactly?”

Jeremy started to plead, “I just wanted to --”

“Shut the fuck up,” Doolie said, holding a finger in front of Jeremy’s face.  “Angie, what did he say to you?”

“He asked about Gil, that’s all,” she said.  “Just wanted to know where Gil was.”

“That’s all?  Nothing about Aaron?”

“No,” Angie said.  “What’s the big deal, Doolie?  He’s just looking for his brother.”

“Gil’s brother Aaron ran away five years ago.  Gil won’t talk about it.  If this punk were his brother, don’t you think he’d know that?”

“I <u>do</u> know it,” shouted Jeremy.

Doolie held up his finger again and glared at Jeremy.  “I told you to shut up.”

“No, <u>you</u> shut up!” Jeremy snapped.  He stepped back out of the range of Doolie’s long arms.  “Don’t  you tell me what I know and what I don’t know.  I’m Gil’s brother, and I’m Aaron’s brother, and you don’t know anything about my family.”

Doolie held up his hands in surrender.  “All right, all right.  Give me a break, kid.  You acted like you thought Aaron was still around.”

“I acted like I hoped he had come home.”

Doolie looked at Angie, puzzled.  “Do you know what he’s talking about?”

Angie waved Doolie off.  “Jeremy, wouldn’t you know if your own brother had come home?”

“No,” Jeremy said, “because haven’t been home for a year.”

Doolie said, “That’s a hell of a story, kid.  You almost had me.”

“It’s <u>true</u>!” Jeremy yelled.  “I ran away a year ago and I just got home today.”

“Jesus,” Doolie said.

“Yeah, Jesus,” Jeremy said.  “Maybe that’s why Gil never mentioned me.”

Doolie regarded Jeremy for a long moment.

Angie pressed against Doolie.  “Doolie, let’s go.”

Doolie put his arm around her and started to turn away from Jeremy.

Jeremy said, “So have you seen my brother?  Gil, I mean?”

“I saw him leaving a few hours ago.”

“Leaving!  Do you --”

“No, I don’t know where he was going.”

Jeremy shook his head and ran his hand through his hair.

“Listen, kid,” Doolie said, “I’m sorry I couldn’t help.  But you’d better not be fucking with me.  Or Gil.  Sounds like you have problems enough already.”

“Oh, you have no idea,” Jeremy said.  “No idea.”

Doolie and Angie looked at Jeremy for a moment longer, then turned and walked away.
