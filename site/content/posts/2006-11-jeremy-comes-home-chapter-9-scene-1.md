On most days The Friendly Roast was quiet.  The mellow atmosphere helped it to earn its name.  You could hold a friendly conversation without having to strain to hear over the din of loud music or conversation.  But on this October Monday morning when Aaron walked into The Friendly Roast it buzzed with animated conversation.  Two people, a man and a woman sat at one table.  Everyone else was standing, waving their arms, and talking loudly.  Most of the talking seemed to questions.  Most of the questions were answered by laughter, shrugs, and replies of "I don't know."

Aaron stopped in the doorway in mid-stride, alarmed.  According to Terry, Foley was about sixty-five years old.  There was nobody here near that age.

What the hell had happened?

Aaron approached the nearest cluster of people, two men and a woman.  "What happened?"

One of the men said, "The cops burst in and busted some guy."

Aaron's temples suddenly buzzed and the back of his neck clenched.  It must have been Foley.  The damned fool must have disregarded Aaron's warning and driven his own car all the way.  That would explain why he had arrived two hours earlier than Aaron had expected.

Trying to appear calm, Aaron said, "No kidding?  What guy?"

"Some old guy," the main said.  He pointed to an empty table in the corner.  "He was sitting right next to us, right there, sipping coffee.  The cops just rushed in through both doors and cornered the guy."

The woman said, "I think his name was Foley.  That's what the one cop yelled at him."

"Wow," Aaron said flatly, barely able to speak.  "That's really..."  He didn't finish the thought.  Instead he turned and walked shakily to the door, where he put a hand against the door frame to steady himself.

God damn that old fool.  Aaron had wanted to get Foley out of Jeremy's life altogether.  And to do that he had to drive a wedge between them.  And to do that he needed to keep them separated until he understood their connection more clearly.  And to do that he needed to control Foley.

Maybe the police had done the job for him.  But more likely they had complicated things.  Maybe instead of gaining control of Foley, Aaron had just lost control of the whole situation.
