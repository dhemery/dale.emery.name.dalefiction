Aaron's truck was an old grey Nissan pickup.  Jeremy closed the door.  Inside the truck was only slightly warmer than outside, but he welcomed even the meager improvement.  He started to remove the coat.

"No, you keep it."  Aaron started the truck and flicked the windshield wipers on.  "It will warm up quickly."

Jeremy sat back in the seat.  He looked over at Aaron, again taking in the mix of strangeness and familiarity.  The smell of Aaron's coat again reminded him of home.

"Aaron, it's really good to see you."

Aaron turned to look at Jeremy.  "Yeah."  He shifted into drive and the truck began to move.

Jeremy suddenly could not feel the cold.  "You don't remember me, do you?"

Aaron looked over his left shoulder to check traffic, then pulled into the street.  He accelerated to match the morning traffic.

"No," he said, and looked at Jeremy.  "I'm sorry.  I don't."

Jeremy turned to look straight ahead.  The commuter traffic sped and slowed, sped and slowed.  The windshield wipers chunked and squeaked, chunked and squeaked.

"That guy you sent said that my brother wanted to see me."

"That's right.  I'm your brother."

Jeremy whirled in the cramped seat.  "But you said--"

"I said I don't remember you.  And I said I'm your brother.  Both true."

"You--  If you don't remember me, how do you know I'm your brother?"

Aaron slowed to a stop behind the stopped cars ahead.  He looked at Jeremy.  "You look like Dad when he was your age."

Jeremy had not seen his father 2001, when Jeremy was nine years old.  He remembered a moment around the kitchen table.  Dinner.  He could not remember sounds, but he remembered the image.  The last image he had of his family, his whole family, together.

Jeremy noticed that he was holding his breath.

"You bastard.  You're playing with me.  You bastard!"

"Jeremy, no."

Jeremy saw tears well up in his brother's eyes.  In Aaron's eyes.

Aaron said, "I'm sorry, Jeremy.  I never know how to do this."

"Do what?"

"Tell a young man that his family is gone, and they will never come back."
