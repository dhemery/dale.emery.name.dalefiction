Nadine held the pot shakily in both hands, which were protected by two oven mitts, one forest green and the other navy blue, that reached to the elbows of her ten-year-old arms.  She tilted the pot over Gil's plate.  A glob of yellowed macaroni elbows slopped out onto the plate.  A stringer of oily cheese sauce ran down the side of the pot and dripped onto the table.

Nadine poured a smaller amount onto her own plate and set the dripping pot back on a cold burner on the stove.

Their mother would not be joining them for dinner.  Today, like yesterday and the day before--every day since that boy had said all of those strange things--was what Natalie Crowther called a "bed day."  Nadine and Gil, when out of earshot of their mother, called them "bad days."

Nadine sat and shuffled her chair up to the table.

"Why did that boy say those things?"

"I don't know, Nadine," Gil said through a mouthful of macaroni and cheese.  "I think he was on drugs.  Or just crazy."

"He looks a lot like you."

Gil stopped chewing and looked at Nadine.  "He looked nothing like me."

"Does, too.  And Dad, too."

"You've got a fertile imagination, Nadine."

"What's 'furdo?'"

"Fertile," Gil said, stretching each syllable and exaggerating each consonant.  "It means you're good at making stuff up."

Nadine looked down at her plate.  She mashed some of the elbows with her fork.

Then she brightened and looked up at Gil.  "I want a nickname," she declared.

"A nickname?  What for?"

"You have a nickname."

"That's because Virgil is a stupid name.  Nadine is a nice name.  It fits you.  It's pretty."

"Well, I want a nickname.  If you can be Gil, I can be Deena?"

"'Deena?'  Where did that come from?"

"I don't know.  I just like it."

"What's wrong with your real name?"

"Deena is my real name.  Part of it.  Just like Gil."

Gil looked at Nadine.  "Good thing your name isn't Wanda, or we'd end up calling you 'duh.'"

Nadine giggled.  "Good thing your name isn't Bruce, or we'd end up calling you 'Oose.'"

Gil laughed.  "That makes no sense."

"I'm Deena.  Okay?"

"Okay, Deena."

"Okay, Oose."

Nadine mashed more macaroni elbows with her fork.

"I think he's a ghost."

"Who's a ghost?"

"That boy."

"Nadine, I don't want--"

"Deena."

"Deena, that kid was crazy, and probably dangerous.  I don't want you to think about him any more."

"I think he's Daddy's ghost."

Gil choked on a noodle.  "God, Nadine, Dad's still alive."

"Maybe alive people can have ghosts, too."

"That makes absolutely no--"

The door bell rang.
