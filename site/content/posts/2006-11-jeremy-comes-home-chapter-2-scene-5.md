Thank goodness rainy season hadn’t started yet in the Sacramento valley.  But after the sun went down the air had cooled rapidly.  Jeremy sat in Mayfield Park with his back against a tree.  He shivered, partly from the cold, and partly from exhaustion.

He tried to make sense of what had happened, but nothing fit.  His mother had acted as if she didn’t recognize him.  No, it was worse than that.  She had said she didn’t even <u>know</u> anyone named Jeremy.

Deena was even more puzzling.  She had said that she knew him, and then said that she didn’t.  Why did she do that?  Was it because of the way her mother had glared at her, the tone of her mother’s voice?

She had said she knew him.  Hadn’t she?  Hadn’t she said it?  Jeremy tried to remember exactly what she had said, but everything had happened so fast that he couldn’t sort it out.

What, exactly, had she said?

“You look familiar.”  That’s what she had said.  Oh, God, not, “I know you,” but “you look familiar.”  Familiar but not family.

Wait a minute.  Hadn’t she said his name?  Hadn’t he called him “Jeremy”?  Yes, he was sure of it.  But he also thought he might have said the name first.  He couldn’t remember for sure.  She had called him by name, but maybe it meant nothing.

But after that, after they had both used his name, both spoken his name, she still didn’t seem to recognize him.  How could that be?  You don’t forget your brother’s name in a year.

It was hard to understand what had happened.  Jeremy wasn’t sure whether Deena had a spark of recognition or not.  Their mother had interrupted them before he could know for sure, before he could ask her for sure whether she recognized him.

But he needed to know.  He needed to understand.  Surely his mother and his sister couldn’t <u>both</u> have pushed him out of their minds.  Could they?  Do those kinds of problems run in the family?

There was only one way to know.  He would have to talk to Deena again.  He had been concerned about talking to her before, concerned that it would cause problems between Deena and their mother.  And yet again the reality had been even worse than he had feared.  The reality had been bizarre, had been <u>unreal</u>.

Talking to Deena could make things worse.  Hah, he thought, how could things be worse than this?  Worse for Deena, he supposed.  He didn’t even know what he feared any more.  He shivered.

But what else could he do?  Did Deena recognize him or not?  He had to know.  And there was only one way to find out.

Jeremy would find Deena tomorrow and talk to her again.  It was a lousy plan, but it was the only plan he had.

[Need better motivation for Jeremy to talk to Deena instead of Gil.]
