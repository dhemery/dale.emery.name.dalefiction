- Jeremy Comes Home

---

Jeremy wandered for a while, unsure what to do next.  Deena would be getting out of school any minute.  Should he try to talk to her?  No, not yet.  Deena would be happy to see him.  Deena would be excited and would want to talk to Mom.  But if Mom was still reacting strangely, that might confuse Deena, or even get her into trouble.

Gil was Jeremy’s only hope.  If Jeremy were going to find out what was going on, he would have to talk to Gil.  Gil would be able to contain his emotions around Mom, and would be able to handle Mom’s problems.

Wherever Gil was now, he would go home eventually, and probably soon, in time for dinner.

For the second time that day, and the second time in a year, Jeremy headed for home.
