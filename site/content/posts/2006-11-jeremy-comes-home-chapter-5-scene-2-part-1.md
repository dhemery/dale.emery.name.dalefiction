<em>NOTE:  Okay, so this scene is coming out even longer than the earlier long one.  I'll post it in chunks.  Maybe later I'll find a way to break it into multiple scenes.</em>

<em>And I know I haven't given Jeremy a motivation to appear where he does at the beginning of the scene.  Simple curiosity might be enough, but probably not.  I might need a scene between the previous one and this one.  (If so, I will write it after I finish the entire draft of the novel.)  Or maybe I can show his motivation through some kind of backfill.  I've done a tiny bit of that in what I've written so far.  We'll see.</em>

The door opened and Page Foley looked out at Jeremy.  Foley stepped back and to the side, swinging the door wide.  He gestured for Jeremy to come in.

Jeremy peered through the door to the part of the house that was visible.  It looked like a living room.  A couch and two cushioned chairs surrounded a magazine-strewn coffee table and aimed in the general direction of an old television set.

Jeremy pointed to the furthest chair.  "You go sit down.  I'll close the door."

Foley nodded and walked to the chair.

Jeremy stepped inside the house and swung the door so that it was slightly ajar.  He turned to Foley.  "Sit."

Foley sat.

Jeremy sat in the other chair, which was closer to the door and angled so that Jeremy could see both Foley and the exit.

He faced Foley with a serious expression.  "How do you know me?"

"I'm not your grandfather.  That's the first thing to clear up."

"I know that."

"But you weren't sure," Foley said.  "And that's important."

"And it must be pretty important to you, too, for you to pull a stunt like that at the police station."

"Fair enough."

"So I'll ask one more time," Jeremy said.  "How do you know me?"

"I remember when you ran away.  Friday, October 20, 2006."

Jeremy jumped to his feet.  That was the date.  How did Foley know that?  Had Jeremy mentioned the date at the police station?  He didn't think so.

Foley had been at the library.  Had Jeremy mentioned the date there?  No.  He hadn't even mentioned running away.

"How do you know that?"

Foley stood up.  Jeremy took two quick backward steps toward the door.

"Careful," Foley said.  Pointing toward Jeremy's feet.

Jeremy looked down to see that if he had taken another step his foot would have hit the curled edge of a carpet.

He looked at Foley.  "What are you doing?"

"I'm trying to answer your question.  I need something from the hall closet."

Foley walked into a hallway that led from the living room toward the back of the house.  Jeremy could not see Foley from where he sat.  He heard Foley turn a doorknob and open a door.

What was Foley doing back there?  What if he had a gun?

As quietly as he could, Jeremy walked to the door.  He held the open edge of the door in his hand, ready to yank it open and run if he needed to.

Foley emerged from the hall, holding a sheet of paper.  He saw Jeremy by the door and paused.  Then he nodded, laid the sheet of paper on the chair in which Jeremy had been sitting, and returned to the chair furthest from the door.  He sat, crossed his hands in his lap, and leaned back and looked at Jeremy.

Jeremy stood by the door.  "What's that?"

"A wanted poster for a runaway boy."

Jesus!  Foley had evidence!

Jeremy ran to the chair and snatched up the paper.  On it was a picture of a boy Jeremy did not recognize.  Beneath was written, "MISSING!  PAUL QUINN.  12 YEARS OLD.  LAST SEEN FRIDAY MORNING WEARING S    STRIPED BLUE SHIRT, JEANS, AND BLACK DENIM JACKET.  ANY INFORMATION CALL 433-7529.  REWARD."

The paper was wrinkled and weathered.  A dozen staple holes pierced the paper around the perimeter and down the center.

"What is this?  Who is Paul Quinn?" Jeremy said.

"I don't know who Paul Quinn is," Foley said.  "When I first saw that tacked on a telephone pole in front of my house one Sunday morning, it said 'Jeremy Crowther' and showed a picture of you."

"Jesus," Jeremy said.  He looked at the sheet of paper, half expecting it to show his name and picture.  Jeremy turned the paper over.  The other side was blank.

"The phone number was different, too."

"Do you remember the number?"

"No, but I remember calling it and talking to a very frightened woman named Natalie Crowther."

Jeremy's hand flew to his mouth and he felt his legs weaken.  He reached behind him to grip the arm rest of the chair, and slowly settled himself into the dusty cushion.  "That's my mother."

"Yes, I know.  I told her that I thought I had seen you two days earlier, wearing a small backback that flopped as if it were empty and eating what I guessed was a candy bar."

"It was a pop tart," Jeremy said, still staring at the picture of Paul Quinn.

"So I was close."

Jeremy felt the tingle in his shoulders and chest that was becoming so familiar, and the tears that were becoming even more familiar.

"She says she doesn't know me," Jeremy said, his voice wavering.  "Why would she say that?"

"Because she doesn't know you, Jeremy."

"But you said--"

"I said she knew you a year ago," Foley said.

"Do you mean she forgot me?  Are you trying to tell me that my mother forgot me?"

"I don't know whether 'forgot' is the right word.  But, yes, I'm saying that a year ago she knew you, and now she does not."

"How could my mother forget me?"

"Whatever happened, Jeremy, I think it goes beyond your mother forgetting you."  Foley gestured toward the paper that Jeremy was holding.

Jeremy stared at the paper dumbly.  Was there some kind of clue he was missing?  Something about the makeshift MISSING poster for Paul Quinn?  The picture looked nothing like him.  The phone number--

"I don't understand."

"What I mean, Jeremy," Foley said, "is how does a piece of paper forget you?"

Jesus, not that.  Jeremy had pieced it together overnight.  In the library he had come face to face with a fact that he could not deny, that even the newspaper article was not as he had remembered it.  It was one thing for people to forget--even four people, including his entire family.  It was another thing altogether for a newspaper to forget him.  It was another thing altogether for physical evidence to disappear.  And not only disappear, but rewrite itself as if he had never existed.  As if everything he thought he knew had been a lie, a fantasy.  As if he had imagined a family, baseball game, an entire past.  It was insane, and insanity had been the only explanation.

But overnight Jeremy had thought of another explanation.  He couldn't explain how his entire family had forgotten him, along with Aidan Corliss.  But if that could be explained--a big if--there was still the physical evidence to deal with.

But most of the physical evidence was not evidence at all, but lack of evidence.  Jeremy had remembered reading somewhere--maybe Sherlock Holmes--that lack of evidence is not evidence of lack.  Just because he couldn't find evidence didn't mean that there was no evidence.

But the newspaper article was not the way he remembered.  The simplest explanation was that Christian Cavezos had turned that miraculous double play, and that Jeremy had fantasized that it had been him.  The simplest explanation was that Jeremy had invented an entire past, an entire family.  The simplest explanation, expressed in the simplest way, was that Jeremy had gone insane.

But overnight Jeremy had thought of another explanation, an explanation that allowed him to cling to some small hope that he was not insane, that the universe was not insane.

Conspiracy.  Somebody--Jeremy did not know who--was pulling a massive prank on him for reasons he could not fathom.  Whoever it was had convinced his family to play along.  Had convinced Aidan Corliss.  Or maybe had hypnotized them all.  (But how had the evil prankster predicted that Jeremy would run into Aidan in that dumpster?  Jeremy pushed the thought aside.)

But hypnotism did not explain the newspaper article.  What explained the newspaper article, Jeremy had realized, was simple hacking.  He had not seen a real, physical paper newspaper.  He had seen some words on a computer screen, words that lived only on some disk drive deep in the bowels of some computer room somewhere.  Words that could be changed by anyone who knew how.

By an unknown evil conspirator bent on driving Jeremy insane.

"Highly improbable," Jeremy had thought to himself as he lay in an alley.  Then he had raised his right hand in a Mr. Spock salute and said the words out loud.  "Highly improbable."

But he remembered what he had learned from Sherlock Holmes.  If you eliminate the impossible, then whatever is left, no matter how improbable, must be true.

Evil conspirators bent on driving him crazy.

It had sounded more reasonable at midnight.
