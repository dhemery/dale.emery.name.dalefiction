<em>[NOTE:  This scene is an unholy mess.  In the previous two chapters I created about six times as many details as I can keep in my head, so my characters--especially in this scene--keep forgetting and remembering all kinds of stuff.</em>

<em>Yonce in particular has become a complete numbskull.  I do like her theory about what's happening (whether it turns out to be the truth or not), but she cuts Foley an awful lot of slack when she has absolutely no motivation to cut him </em>any<em>.</em>

<em>At revision time this scene is going to kill me.]</em>

The interrogation room in the Portland Central Precinct reminded Foley of the last interrogation room he had been in thirty nine hours earlier--the same flat grey walls, the same shuttered windows facing a hallway, the same mirror on the same side wall.

Officer Sherman Dortmunder dialed a number on the triangular speaker phone that sat on the bare table in the center of the room.

"Officer Yonce, Sacramento Police Department."

"Dortmunder here, Officer Yonce.  With your fugitive Foley."

Yonce said, "Good morning, Mister Foley."

"It's nice to talk with you again so soon, Officer Yonce."

"It would have been a lot more pleasant if you had kept your appointment."

"Yes, that has become apparent to me.  I can see the error of my ways.  Can we reschedule for later in the week?"

"I'm free right now, Mister Foley.  Or did you have something else that you'd rather be doing?"

"I'd rather be looking for Jeremy Crowther."

"Jeremy who?"

Dear God, had Yonce now forgotten Jeremy?  "Jesus!  I--"

"Relax, Mister Foley.  I'm joking."

Joking!  "For God's sake, Officer Yonce, please don't do that again.  Not if you expect me to live through our conversation.  Jeremy's--  Jeremy's situation is of some concern to me."

"I'm sorry, Mister Foley.  You have my word," Yonce said.  "You referred to Jeremy's condition.  What exactly is Jeremy's condition?"

"That his family and friends have all forgotten that he existed."

"Now you're joking with me."

"I assure you that I am not."

"Mister Foley, Have you been in contact with Aaron Crowther?"

"Yes, I have, and I'm sure you know that."

"And what makes you so sure of that?"

"The arrival of my two escorts at the coffee shop, for one thing.  Obviously Aaron tipped you off to where I would be.  Nobody else knew."

"Aaron--"  Yonce sounded genuinely surprised at Foley's statement.  "Ah, I can see why you would think that.  But, no, Aaron Crowther did not tip us off."

"How did you locate me, then?  My rental car?"

"Not exactly, though that helped the officers to confirm that you were in the area.  Listen, let's leave our investigative techniques aside for now, shall we?"

"What would you like to talk about?"

"Do you know where Jeremy Crowther is?"

"Not his physical location, no.  But I believe he is with his brother Aaron.  That's why he came here, to reunite with his brother."

"His brother who doesn't know who he is?"

Foley buried his head in his hands and grunted.  <u>Did</u> Aaron know who Jeremy was?  Everyone else had forgotten Jeremy.  Everyone, that is, except Foley.  What was the connection between Foley and Aaron?  That's one of the things he had come here to find out.

"I don't know."

"I see."

"You do?"  Foley laughed.  "I wish you would explain it to me, then."

"You said that Jeremy's entire family had forgotten him."

"Yes.  I may have overstated, if that is possible in this situation.  I don't know whether Aaron remembers Jeremy."

"Why would a brother who has not seen Jeremy in six years remember him when his mother does not?"

"I don't know.  That very puzzle has been much on my mind for the past two days."

"Mister Foley, does it seem likely to you that a boy's entire family could forget that he ever existed?"

How could Foley explain?  After fifty years of questioning and analyzing, analyzing the questions and questioning the analysis, Foley could not explain what had happened to him on that hill in Korea.  And even now that the same thing had happened to Jeremy, nothing that Foley had learned from Jeremy's situation had helped to explain any part of it.

Yonce said, "Was that a difficult question, Mister Foley?"

Foley glared at the telephone.

"Officer Dortmunder, did the question I just asked seem to you to be a difficult one?"

"No, Ma'am."

"I didn't think so, either.  Mister Foley, what makes my question so challenging for you?"

"I don't know how to answer that."

"Do you mean that you don't know the answer?"

"No.  I mean that I don't know how to put the answer into words that make sense."

Yonce said, "Officer Dortmunder, if a young man told you that his entire family had forgotten who he was, what conclusions would you draw from that?"

"I'd say he was lying.  Or maybe he had some psychological problems."

"Mister Foley, you actually believe Jeremy, don't you?  You believe that his family forgot him."

"Yes, I do."

"When a simpler explanation would be that he is either lying or delusional."

"I believe him."

"Why on earth would you believe such obviously outrageous claim?"

"Because it isn't obvious to me that it is even false, much less outrageous."

"Officer Dortmunder?"

"It's obvious to me."

"Mister Foley, how long have you known Aaron Crowther?"

"What?" Foley said, confused about Yonce's non-sequitur.  "I met him by telephone last night.  I have never met him in person.  I was waiting for him in the coffee shop when--"

"What is Jeremy's sister's name?"

What the hell?  What did that have to do with anything?  "Deena, I think.  Or Nadine.  I'm not sure."

"And how long have you known Aaron Crowther?"

"I--  I just told you.  I've never actually--"

"How long have you known Jeremy?"

Yonce was clearly trying to throw him off balance, and it was working.  "I met Jeremy Saturday evening at the police station."

"You said you were his grandfather."

"Yes, I--"

"That was a lie, wasn't it."

"Yes.  Yes it--"

"Why did you abduct Jeremy Crowther and flee the state?"

"I didn't abduct Jeremy.  He went on his own, by bus.  I followed."

"Why did Jeremy flee?"

"He wasn't fleeing, exactly.  He was coming here to Portland to meet his brother."

"His brother who doesn't remember him."

"Dammit, I don't know!"  Foley slammed a fist on the table.  The speaker phone bounced from the force.

Dortmunder said, "Am I going to have to cuff you?"

"No, no, I'm sorry," Foley said.  "May I stand up for a moment so that I can breathe a little?"

"Feel free."

Foley stood and slid his chair under the table.  He walked slowly to one corner of the room, then to another.

Finally he said, "Officer Yonce, could we take this more slowly please?  I'm having a hard time keeping up with the changes in direction."

"And I'm having a hard time getting straight answers from you, Mister Foley."

"And while you and I are wasting our time here, Jeremy is in danger."

"What was that?"

"I said Jeremy is in danger.  When are you--"

"What sort of danger is Jeremy in?"

"I don't know, exactly.  But something about his brother, about Aaron, feels wrong."

"You think Aaron is a danger to Jeremy?  What makes you think that?"

"I--  I don't know.  I don't know how to explain it.  Something about his story doesn't fit."

"Can you be more specific?"

"I'm sorry, I can't.  I've thought about nothing else for the past twelve hours.  I don't know why, but--"

"What did you say was Jeremy's sister's name?"

"For Christ's sake, please stop changing the subject."

"I'm sorry, Mister Foley.  I know it seems like I'm jumping around, but I assure you this is all the same topic to me.  Please answer my question."

"Her name is Deena.  Sometimes Jeremy calls her Nadine."

"Why did you go to the Crowthers' house last night?"

"I was looking for information about Aaron.  And to give them information about Aaron.  But, no, that was just an excuse.  I was looking for information about Aaron."

"What information did you have to offer?"

"I had Aaron's telephone number."

"How did you come to be in possession of his phone number?"

"I got it from the cell phone of a man who came to my house looking for Jeremy."

"What man?"

"Terry Mortenson, I think his name was.  He dropped his cell phone when he fell."

"Was there a fight?"

"Not exactly.  He... got in the way of my car."

"And this man's cell phone had Aaron's telephone number?

"That's right."

"And you thought the Crowthers would be pleased to learn how to contact Aaron?"

"Yes."

"And give you information in return?"

"Yes."

"How did you know the name of Jeremy's sister?"

"Jeremy told me about her."

"And he told you her name was Deena?"

"Yes.  Officer Yonce, I don't understand.  What is so important about Deena's name?"

"When did Jeremy tell you about his sister?"

"Earlier that day.  Before you came to the house."

"About five hours ago I received a phone call from Gil Crowther.  Do you know what he told me?"

"I'm afraid I upset him a great deal."

"Yes you did.  And do you know how you upset him?"

"I think he was distraught that I wanted to talk to his mother about Aaron."

"Actually, he was more upset about something else."

Foley remembered.  The conversation had become surreal when Deena had stepped into the doorway.  When Foley had said her name.

"My God, you're right.  Deena came to the door and I said hello.  And then all hell broke loose.  Gil became enraged.  He kept asking me how I knew her name.  And she kept smiling and insisting that it <u>was</u> her name.  For my part, I had no idea what we were talking about.  That whole conversation was quite puzzling and distressing, for both Gil and me.  I would dearly love to know, Officer Yonce, what is so important about Deena's name."

"Do you have any idea when Nadine got the nickname Deena?"

"What?  No.  I didn't know it was a nickname.  That's what Jeremy called her.  I thought it was her name."

"She began calling herself Deena at about six thirty last evening."

"Six thirty?  That doesn't make sense."

"So now we're even."

"But Jeremy called her Deena that morning."

"Gil assures me that Nadine chose the nickname Deena last night at around six thirty, while they were at the table eating dinner.  Within minutes, you arrive and call her Deena.  And an hour later, Gil calls Aaron--thanks to the phone number you left for him.  And guess what?  Aaron asks about his sister Deena."

"This must be related--"

"Related to what, Mister Foley?"

"Related to what happened to Jeremy.  How his family..."

"How his family does not know who he is?"

"Yes."

"I think you're right."

"You--  You do?"

"Yes.  I think I can explain all of it.  Or almost all of it."

"Officer Yonce, you promised no more joking."

"I'm quite serious, Mister Foley.  I'd like you to hear me out, and when I'm done I want to ask you for a favor."

Foley was confused and dubious.  Was Yonce being sincere, or was she setting him up to confusing him again, to try to shake new information out of him?  "All right.  If you can explain this, I'd like to hear it."

"I believe that Aaron Crowther runs some sort of cult.  He abducts young people who have run away from home, and brainwashes them or hypnotizes them into believing they are members of some family.  He plants a mixture of valid information and false memories.  When a young runaway attempts to return to what he falsely believes is his home, he finds that his 'family' has 'forgotten' him.  Are you with me so far?"

My God, Foley thought.  This was a pretty good theory, given the facts that Yonce had.  If Foley had thought of this fifty years ago, he might have even accepted it as an explanation for his own experience.  That is, until the poster of Jeremy Crowther became a poster of Paul Quinn, and until Jeremy Crowther returned to find his past erased.

"Yes, yes I think so.  Officer Yonce, your theory fits something that Aaron told me.  He said that he works with children such as Jeremy."

"Children such as Jeremy.  Do you know what happens to a child such as Jeremy?  A young man who suddenly finds that his family does not know who he is?"

"I'd say that he questions his sanity.  And that his very identity becomes extremely fragile."

"Which makes him quite vulnerable, and quite susceptible to, say, a charismatic older boy who seems to offer solace and structure."

"That's... quite a theory.  And you got all of that from Jeremy's story?" Foley asked.

"That and some additional information.  That man Terry who came for Jeremy yesterday is an accomplice of Aaron's.  He told me essentially what you just told me, that Aaron is 'working with' at least a dozen of these runaway children."

"Remarkable," Foley said.  Remarkable that the theory fit so many of that facts that Yonce knew.  "You said that this ties in somehow with the importance of Deena's name?"

"It turns out that Jeremy himself unwittingly gave Nadine the idea for her nickname.  He called her Deena several times when he saw her briefly in front of the Crowthers' home."

"If you knew all of that, then why did you run me through the ringer about her name?"

"I needed to know what you knew and when you knew it.  I needed to know whether you were an accomplice of Aaron Crowther."

"An accomplice!"

"You must admit, your behavior was peculiar.  You interrupted our conversation with Jeremy to tell us that you were his grandfather.  Then you attempted to flee your home with him.  Yes, I know about that, too.  Mister Mortenson said you nearly ran him over.  And you also 'knew' Nadine's nickname, when she hadn't yet given herself the nickname.  I needed to know whether you had heard her nickname from Jeremy, or from Aaron."

"So you think that as part of hypnotizing Jeremy, Aaron gave him a memory of a sister whose nickname was Deena?"

"That's my best guess.  It certainly isn't the shakiest part of my theory."

No, Foley thought.  No it wasn't.  But Foley thought it best not to poke holes at it right now.  And some of it--for example, Aaron 'working with' these horribly vulnerable children for purposes unknown--rang true.  Foley decided to bolster Yonce's theory.

"Aaron asked me to come to Portland to meet with him.  What he <u>said</u> was that I might be able to help with the children he works with.  He calls them 'The Forgotten.'"

"You suspect other motives?"

"I think he wants me where he can see me.  Perhaps he suspects that I've learned too much about his operation."

"And you accepted his invitation?  What was your reason for doing that?"

Foley laughed.  "I want Aaron where I could see him.  I want to learn more about his operation."

"Ah," Yonce said.  "And this brings us to that favor I mentioned."
