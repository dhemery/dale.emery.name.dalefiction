Nils Rollins ran down the stairs and into the church basement.  Panting, he said, "What's the emergency, Aaron?"

"This thing with Jeremy keeps getting stranger.  It doesn't fit the pattern."

"What happened?"

"You know that guy Foley?  The one who said he was Jeremy's grandfather?"

Nils remembered how Aaron had stomped around the basement after he found out that this guy had said he was Jeremy's grandfather.  Nils had never seen Aaron so stressed before.  "Yeah, I remember."

"Foley just called me."

"Holy crap.  How did he get your number?"

"He was calling from Terry's phone."

"What?  What happened to Terry?"

"Later."  Aaron waved the question away.  "Nils, Foley says he talked to my mother."

"So?"

"He called her a year ago to talk about Jeremy."

"A year ago?"

"Apparently he saw some sort of missing person poster about Jeremy and called my mother to say he'd seen him."

"Was this before or after Jeremy was Forgotten?"

"It must have been before."

"Okay.  So what's the--"  Then Nils understood.  When a person is Forgotten, everybody forgets them.  Everybody.  But if Foley remembered calling Jeremy's mother, if he remembered the poster from before Jeremy was Forgotten...  "Holy shit!"

"Yeah, holy shit."

"Why does Foley remember Jeremy?"

"Exactly.  As far as we know, nobody has ever remembered a Forgotten before.  So why does Foley remember?  And why Jeremy?"
