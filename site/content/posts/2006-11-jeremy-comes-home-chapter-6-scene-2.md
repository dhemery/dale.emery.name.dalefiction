<em> NOTE:  As I said in my last post, the past few days have been a real slog.  Jeremy and Page talk and talk and talk, and not much happens.  It's useful backstory, but it's deadly dull.  Last night at our writer's group meeting, Richard (aka </em><em><font><em><a href="http://underpope.livejournal.com/profile"><img src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="[info]" height="17" width="17" /></a><a href="http://underpope.livejournal.com/"><strong>underpope</strong></a></em>) said, "It's starting to read like a NaNo novel."  Exactly.  Lots of words.  Little movement.  Given that this </font></em><font>is<em> a NaNo novel, that's not the worst thing that could happen.  But what to do?  What to do?</em>
<em>
Meanwhile, I'm reading Jerry Cleaver's </em>Immediate Fiction<em>, and finding it enormously helpful.  In chapter four Cleaver advises against having two characters sitting around just exchanging information.  Instead, "Each character must serve a purpose, which is to rub another in a way that will reveal something meaningful about both of them."</em></font>

<font><em>That got me thinking.  I didn't know exactly what I wanted to happen next in the story, but I was half-heartedly planning a road trip with more talking.  With Cleaver's admonition and Richard's comment ringing in my ears, I asked myself how I could get Jeremy and Foley to end their chit chat and do something interesting.  This is what came out.
</em>
Foley held a finger to his lips.  He held his hands up with his palms toward Jeremy, telling Jeremy to stay put beside the car.  Jeremy nodded and set his backpack down beside the passenger door.</font>

<font>    Had Yonce decided that Foley and Jeremy were a flight risk?  Had she returned with a search warrant?</font>

<font>    Foley walked in a crouch to the side of his house.  He felt ridiculous, and probably looked as ridiculous as he felt.  He crept along the side of the house until he reached the corner.  Slowly he peeked around the edge of the house.</font>

<font>    On his doorstep stood a young man, maybe thirty years old, dressed in a baseball cap, jeans, and an open button-down shirt over an white crew neck T-shirt.  The man took a pack of cigarettes out of his shirt pocket and scanned the street.</font>

<font>    Foley ducked quickly behind the edge of the house.</font>

<font>    Who was this guy?  Was he with the police?  An undercover officer?</font>

<font>    Foley turned toward Jeremy.</font>

<font>    Jeremy mouthed the question, "Who?"</font>

<font>    Foley shrugged and shook his head.  He crept back to where Jeremy stood beside the car.  Whispering, he said, "I don't know who it is.  Whoever it is, he's looking around as if he doesn't want to be seen.  We've got to get out of here."</font>

<font>    Jeremy reached for his backpack.</font>

<font>    "Wait.  Wait until I count three, then get in as quickly as you can."</font>

<font>    Foley walked around the car and picked up the small suitcase he had set beside the driver's door.</font>

<font>    In the house the doorbell rang again.</font>

<font>    Foley reached for the car door handle.  He held up one finger, then two, then three.</font>

<font>    Foley yanked the door open and swung his suitcase through and over the seat.  He jumped into the seat.</font>

<font>    To his right Jeremy landed in the passenger's seat, but his backpack caught in the crook of the door.</font>

<font>    "Hurry up!" Foley jammed the key into the ignition and twisted it.</font>

<font>    Jeremy yanked his backpack, but it was stuck.  He yanked again and it jerked free, sending Jeremy over backward onto the center console.</font>

<font>    Foley slammed the gearshift lever into reverse.  "Close the door!"</font>

<font>    Jeremy righted himself and grabbed the door as the the car began to move.</font>

<font>    Foley turned, swung his right arm over the seat, and looked through the rear window.</font>

<font>    The man in the baseball cap ran around the corner toward the car.</font>

<font>    Foley stomped on the gas pedal and the car lurched backward.</font>

<font>    Jeremy's door swung open.</font>

<font>    The man ran behind the car.</font>

<font>    Foley instinctively hit the brakes.  Jeremy's door slammed shut.</font>

<font>    "Fuck!" Jeremy shouted.  "That almost took my arm off!"</font>

<font>    "Hold on!" Foley yelled as he lifted his foot from the brake.  The car rolled backward.</font>

<font>    The man slammed his hands on the hood of the car.  "Jeremy!" he shouted.  "Jeremy, wait!"</font>

<font>    Shit!  Foley hit the brakes again, hard.</font>

<font>    Jeremy spun in his seat.  "What the hell?"</font>

<font>    The car jolted to a stop.</font>

<font>    "Jeremy!"  The man behind the car held up his hands to signal stop.  "Aaron wants to see you!"</font>

<font>    "What!" Jeremy cried.</font>

<font>    Foley stomped on the gas pedal, jerking the car into motion.</font>

<font>    The man spun out of the way, lost his balance, and sprawled onto the lawn.</font>

<font>    "No, Foley, wait!" Jeremy yelled.  "Page, wait!"</font>

<font>    "We have to go!"</font>

<font>    "Page, wait!  He knows my brother!"</font>

<font>    "Jeremy, we have to go!"</font>

<font>    The car reached the edge of the driveway and Foley spun the wheel.  He braked the car to a rocking stop and shifted into drive.</font>

<font>    As Foley shifted his foot the the gas pedal, Jeremy opened his door and jumped out.</font>

<font>    Foley stomped on the brake.  "Jeremy, what are you doing!"</font>

<font>    Foley turned the car off and watched through the open passenger door.</font>

<font>    Jeremy ran toward the man on the lawn.  "Where is my brother?  Where is Aaron?"</font>

<font>    The man held up a hand and crabbed backward with the other.  "Whoa!  Whoa!"</font>

<font>    Foley shouted, "Jeremy, be careful!"  He opened the driver's door and stepped his left foot out.</font>

<font>    "Where is my brother?  Where is he?"  Jeremy reached down with both hands and grabbed the man by the shirt.</font>

<font>    "Jeremy, easy!  I'm a friend!  A friend of Aaron's!  I'm a friend!"  The man lay back like a dog offering its throat in submission.</font>

<font>    "Who are you?"</font>

<font>    "Terry.  Terry Mortenson.  I'm a friend of Aaron's."</font>

<font>    Foley stood and watched over the roof of the car.  Something was wrong.  The way the man had looked around on the porch...  Something was wrong.</font>

<font>    "Jeremy," Foley said.  "You don't know if you can trust this guy."</font>

<font>    Jeremy spun toward Foley.  "Oh?  And how do I know that I can trust you?"</font>

<font>    The bite in Jeremy's voice stung Foley even more than the words.  What stung even more was that Foley had no answer.</font>

<font>    A smile flicked across Mortenson's face, then snicked away like a switchblade as Jeremy turned again to face him.</font>

<font>    "Get up," Jeremy said and backed away from Mortenson.  "Where is Aaron?"</font>

<font>    Mortenson looked at Foley.  "Let's go somewhere where we can talk."</font>

<font>    "Jeremy!"  Foley started toward the back of the car.</font>

<font>    "Stay back, old man," Mortenson said.</font>

<font>    Foley kept moving.  "Jeremy, this isn't right."</font>

<font>    Mortenson too two steps toward Foley.</font>

<font>    "Hey!" Jeremy shouted.  He stepped in between the two men and held his arms out like a traffic cop.  He looked at Foley.  "Page, don't!"</font>

<font>    Foley stopped.</font>

<font>    Jeremy turned to Mortenson.  "Where is my brother?"</font>

<font>    "I'll tell you, but not him."  Mortenson pointed toward Foley.</font>

<font>    "Anything you can tell me you can tell him."</font>

<font>    "This is between you and Aaron."</font>

<font>    Jeremy looked from Mortenson to Foley.</font>

<font>    Mortenson said, "Jeremy, we need to go somewhere."</font>

<font>    Foley pleaded, "Jeremy, don't do it.  You don't know--"</font>

<font>    "Foley," Jeremy spat, "be quiet."</font>

<font>    Jesus, no.  Couldn't Jeremy see that something was terribly wrong?</font>

<font>    Jeremy turned to Mortenson.  "I'm not going anywhere with you until you give me some information.  Where is my brother?"</font>

<font>    Mortenson looked around.  He pointed toward the street corner a few dozen yards away.  "How about if we just go over there?  If you don't like what I have to say, I'll go.  Fair enough?"</font>

<font>    "Jeremy--"</font>

<font>    Jeremy turned on Foley.  "Foley, shut the fuck up!"</font>

<font>    Foley could think of nothing to do, nothing to say.  He stepped back and held his hands out to his sides.  "Okay.  Whatever you need to do."</font>

<font>    Foley watched, helpless, as Jeremy and Mortenson walked to the corner of the street.  The spoke back and forth for a moment.  Then Jeremy turned and walked toward where Foley stood.</font>

<font>    "Page, I have to go.  Aaron is the only family I have left.  I have to go."</font>

<font>    "Jeremy, you don't know anything about this guy.  You don't know if it's safe."</font>

<font>    "I don't have to.  Mortenson told me where Aaron is.  He is going to drive away, and I'm going to make my own way to Aaron."</font>

<font>    "What if he follows--"</font>

<font>    "I'm going to take a bus.  If Mortenson tries to follow me, I can take care of myself.  But I don't think he will."</font>

<font>    "I'll come with you."</font>

<font>    "No, Page.  Aaron doesn't trust you."</font>

<font>    "Trust me?  How does he even know about me?"</font>

<font>    "Mortenson has a friend on the police force.  That's how he knew where to find me.  And he knows the story you told in there.  Page, I trust you.  Jeremy doesn't.  And I have to go."</font>

<font>    "You said he was going to drive away."</font>

<font>    Jeremy turned to Mortenson.  "Are we done?"</font>

<font>    Mortenson nodded.</font>

<font>    "Then it's time for you to go."</font>

<font>    Mortenson hesitated, then walked across the street.  He got into an old red Sentra and drove away.</font>

<font>    "Page, thank you for everything."</font>

<font>    "Jeremy--"</font>

<font>    "I have to go now.  Aaron is my only family now.  I have to go."</font>

<font>    "I'll take you to the bus stop."</font>

<font>    "I'll walk," Jeremy said.  He went to the passenger side of Foley's car and pulled his backback off the floor in front of the front seat.  "I can catch a bus at Mayfield park."</font>

<font>    "Jeremy, there's more we need to talk about.  What happened."</font>

<font>    "There will be time for that later."</font>

<font>    Jeremy turned and walked toward Mayfied Park.</font>

<font>    The passenger door of Foley's car was still open.  Foley went around the front of the car to close it.</font>

<font>    Something glinted on the lawn.  That was the spot where Mortenson had fallen.  Foley went to the grass and looked down.</font>

<font>    There in the grass was a cell phone.  Mortenson's cell phone.</font>
