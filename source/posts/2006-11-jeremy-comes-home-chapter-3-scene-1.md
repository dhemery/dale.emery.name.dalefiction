Jeremy lay on a bench in Mayfield Park, with his feet flat on the bench so that his knees stuck up.  He held his head with both hands as if trying to keep it from bursting.

What the hell was going on?  First his mother, then Deena, and now Gil.  What on earth was happening?  What on earth was his family doing to him?

Had they all ganged up on him, conspired to punish him for the pain he had caused them by running away?  That didn't make any sense.  For one thing, Gil had barely been able to talk to his mother, much less collaborate with her.  For another thing--

Dammit, this made no sense.

If this was not a conspiracy, then what?  A curse?  Had he pissed off a witch or a cajun voodoo priestess or something?

Jeremy realized that he was holding his breath, and let it out in a whoosh.  He stretched his legs so that they stuck out past the end of the bench, and let his right hand drop to the ground.

Out of the corner of his eye he saw a shape.  He turned his head to see an old man about thirty feet away staring at him.

Startled, Jeremy sat up quickly, which sent a fresh burst of pain to his left cheek where Gil had punched him.

The man stared at Jeremy with an odd expression.

Jeremy had lived enough time on the street to know that an old man staring at a lone kid in a park could not be good news.

"What are you staring at, old man?"

The man shook his head.

"I'm sorry.  You just look pretty banged up."

Jeremy didn't have time for this.

"What's it to you?"

The man moved a few steps closer.  Jeremy stood up.

"Just stay away from me, okay?"

"Okay," the man said, holding up his hands.  "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine.  Leave me alone."

"You're bleeding."

"I know I'm bleeding.  I was there when he hit me.  Get away from me, you pervert."

The man stepped back and tilted his head.  "You should get that looked at."

"And you should play with boys your own age."

The man physically recoiled as if Jeremy had struck him.  "Get that looked at," he said.  Then he turned and walked away.

Jeremy picked up his backpack and walked in the opposite direction.
