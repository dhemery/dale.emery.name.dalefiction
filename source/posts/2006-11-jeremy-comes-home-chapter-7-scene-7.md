On the passenger seat, Mortenson's cell phone rang.  Foley picked it up.  The outer display read, "Incoming call...  Aaron Crowther."

Jesus!  What the hell did Crowther want?  And whatever he wanted, why did he think Foley would oblige him?

He flipped the phone open and held it to his ear.  "Hello, Aaron."

"Mister Foley."

"You promised to answer my questions."

"I'm sorry, Mister Foley," Aaron said with all the sincerity of a telemarketer.  "Please forgive me.  I've been distraught by the recent events.  In all of the confusion I may have misinterpreted your intentions."

"My intentions?"

"Yesterday you lied to the police and walked away with a boy who was claiming to be a member of my family.  And a few hours ago you visited my family and told them how to contact me.  I don't understand your interest in my family."

Claiming to be a member?  Did Aaron know that Jeremy was his brother, or not?

"You said you would answer my questions.  Is that offer still open?"

"I suppose so."

"Well let's start with this one.  Do you have a brother named Jeremy?"

Foley listened to silence on the line.

"Aaron?  It's a simple enough question."

"Actually, Mister Foley, you've asked a very complicated question.  And I think you know that."

"Do you have a brother named Jeremy or not?"

"Yes and no."

"Explain."

"This will make sense to you only if you already know the explanation."

"So humor me."

"I believe that I do have a brother named Jeremy.  At the same time, I have no memory of ever having a brother named Jeremy.  Are you with me so far?"

"Go on."

"I believe that I once knew Jeremy, and that something happened a year ago to remove my memory of him.  And not only my memory, but the memories of everyone who ever knew him."

"Only memories?"

"Mister Foley, I would like to ask a question of you before I go on."

"We tried that in the last phone call.  I don't trust you."

"Fair enough.  As to your last question, no, not only memories.  Every trace of Jeremy's existence before that moment a year ago is gone.  I don't know the details of what those traces might be, but whatever impressions Jeremy had made on the world before a year ago are now gone."

"Next question.  How do you know all of this?"

"Because this phenomenon, whatever it is, has happened to many children, mostly children who have run away from home.  Some of these children find the world harsher than whatever troubles and abuses they were running away from, and wish to return home.  When they return home they find that--how shall I say this?--home is no longer home.  Their family does not remember them."

Jesus.  This had happened not just twice, but many times.  How many times?  And God, those poor kids.

Foley realized that he had relaxed his foot on the accelerator and was driving only fifty miles per hour.  Cars passed him at
dangerous speeds.  He pressed the gas pedal.

"You've seen this before?"

"Yes, Mister Foley.  Jeremy is not the first, and I'm sure he won't be the last."

"But all of those kids... My God!"

"Exactly.  I can't imagine anything more terrifying for a child than to lose his entire family.  It is more painful than losing the family to death.  Death, as horrible and final as it is, is at least explainable.  But this...  And that's why I make it my business to help each child cope with the loss of his family."

"You... what?"

"I run a program here in Portland.  A kind of support group for these children who have lost their families.  We call them The Forgotten."

Good God.  How many of these children were there?  Foley had spent most of his life believing that he was the only one who had lost his family, his past, his identity in this way.  And then Jeremy had suffered the same horrifying fate--<u>was</u> suffering it even now.

If what Aaron was saying was true, then this awful thing had happened not just twice, but many times.  To many children.  Many!

Foley tried to concentrate on the road in front of him.

"Are you there?"

Aaron's voice brought Foley back to the telephone call.  "Yes.  I'm sorry, this is a lot to take in all at once."

"Indeed it is, Mister Foley.  Every new piece of information brings implications upon implications."

"Yes, that's what I was thinking about.  So many children...  The pain they must be suffering..."

"Exactly.  The implications are overwhelming.  So perhaps now you can forgive my earlier rude behavior toward you."

"Your--"  Foley remembered the previous conversation, how Aaron had terminated the call once he'd gotten what he needed.  "Oh, that.  Yes."

Suddenly Foley's sense of unease returned.  There was something about that conversation, something that had not been resolved.  Where was his unease coming from?  From how the conversation ended.  Aaron had asked how Foley had happened to call Natalie Crowther.

"Mister Foley, I want to--"

"Wait a minute.  There's something that's bothering me, Mister Crowther.  You haven't told me why you called."

"Exactly so.  I was just getting to that.  But I'm glad that we talked about these other things first.  That background provides some context for my request."

"And what request is that?"

"I want you to come to Portland."

"Oh?"

"I want you to work with me to help these children."

"You want me to what?  Four hours ago you weren't willing to talk to me.  Now you want me to work with you?"

"Yes, that's right.  I want you to work with me to help these children.  Are you interested?"

"Why the change of heart?"

"Because, Mister Foley, there's something very special about you."

Suddenly Foley's hackles went up.  Did Aaron know that Foley, too, was a--what had he called it--a Forgotten?  No, that couldn't be right.  How <u>could</u> he know?

"And what is so special about me?"

"You remember Jeremy."

"What's so special about that?"

"Jeremy is, as far as we can tell, a Forgotten.  And yet you remember him.  We have never seen that before.  We have never known anyone to remember a Forgotten."

Foley had not noticed that in remembering Jeremy he was in any way unusual.  But of course, if Jeremy's entire family had forgotten him, if even the newspaper had forgotten him, why should Foley remember?  The question had simply not occurred to him.

"Jesus."

"So do you see the significance?"

"Yes.  Until this moment it had not occurred to me that simply remembering Jeremy was unusual."

"And now?"

"It's remarkable."  Even more remarkable given that after Foley had been forgotten he had never found anyone who had remembered him.  Not the people in his Army troupe.  Not his family.  Not his friends.  Nobody.

Suddenly Foley realized the significance of what he had just said.  <u>Remarkable.</u>  Remembering Jeremy would be remarkable only if he had some reason not to expect it.  If Jeremy had been Foley's first experience with this phenomenon, he would have no reason to think that his remembering was remarkable.  It was remarkable only because he himself had been Forgotten.

Foley did not want to give Aaron that bit of information.

"Remarkable, I mean, if what you say is true.  If nobody has ever remembered one of these Forgotten children before, then my remembering Jeremy is remarkable."

"We are hoping that whatever it is that allows you to remember Jeremy will give us a better understanding about this whole puzzling phenomenon.  If we can find out what it is about you that allows you to remember Jeremy, perhaps we can use that to help these other children.  Will you help us?"

Had Foley misjudged Aaron?  Aaron seemed to have an answer for each of Foley's concerns.  And when we're in chaos, Foley knew, we often jump to conclusions, we often grasp any seeming explanation that helps to make sense of the unfathomable.

And yet Foley trusted his instincts.  He could not shake his feeling that Aaron was not telling him everything.  Perhaps that was just his own paranoia, or a projection of his own choice to keep his own secrets.

"Mister Foley, there are two other reasons that I want you here.  The first is that Jeremy seems to trust you.  That trust will help him to cope with what he is going through.  And the fact that you remember him, if only through a missing person poster, gives him a touchstone, and connection to his past that other Forgotten only yearn for.

"The second is reason is that, as important as this phenomenon has become to me over the past few years, as important as it has been for me to help these children, I am now more eager than ever to understand what is causing it and how to stop it.  Because now my own family is involved.

"Mister Foley, please.  Will you come?"

Foley did not understand why, but Aaron's speech left him even more uneasy.  It felt like a sales pitch.

And yet it gave Foley an invitation to do what he had planned to do anyway, to find Jeremy and protect him.

Protect him from what?  From connecting with the one member of his family who at least acknowledged his existence?  From having one more touchstone to his own reality?

Foley didn't know.  But he was going to find out.

"All right, Aaron.  I'm on my way.  Where will I find you?"

Aaron gave Foley the address.  Foley repeated it once out loud, then rehearsed it in his head several more times.

Foley had passed through Redding an hour earlier.  He would reach Portland in another six hours.

He said, "It will take me ten hours to reach you from Sacramento."

"Will you be driving a dark blue Camry?"

How the hell--  "Yes, I drive a Camry."

"You may want to switch cars," Aaron said.  "The police are watching for your Camry."

"Jesus!"  Where could Foley find another car at this time of night?  And in the middle of nowhere?  And without drawing attention to himself?

"In that case, expect me a little later."
