Aaron pulled the truck into a parking lot beside the church.  A swinging wooden sign hanging by the front door read, "First Congregational Church of Portland.  Traditional Service Sunday 9 a.m.  Contemporary Service Sunday 11 a.m.  Pastor James Rollins."

"What's this?" Jeremy said.  "Did you get religion?"

"Not exactly.  The pastor is a friend of mine.  I'm a... friend of the family, you might say.  He lets me work here."

"You work in a church?"

"Not the way you're thinking.  He just lets me use a room."

Aaron led Jeremy behind the main church building to a smaller attached building.  Both were simple wooden clapboard buildings, painted simple white and trimmed in black.  On the side of the rear building was a windowless door set a foot below the parking lot level, accessed by three concrete steps and a landing.  Aaron opened the door without unlocking it.

Eight simple wooden stairs, painted brown, led down.  A light was on.  Jeremy followed Aaron down the stairs.  The floor was covered with pale green industrial carpet, the walls with chestnut brown paneling.  Folding chairs aligned in rows, their backs to the door, took up half of the room.

At the front of the room a boy, older than Jeremy and younger than Aaron, sat on a wooden table, leaning forward as if in anticipation of having to do something mildly unpleasant but necessary.  As Aaron and Jeremy approached, the boy stood and extended his hand.

Aaron said, "Jeremy, meet Nils Rollins."

"Rollins."  Jeremy shook the boy's hand.  "Like Pastor Rollins?"

"He's my father," Nils said.  He fixed his gaze on Jeremy's.  "And he does not remember that I'm his son."

"Holy shit," Jeremy said.  He turned to Aaron in surprise.

Aaron nodded.  "He's like you, Jeremy."  Then he smiled and looked up as if through the ceiling.  "And maybe don't say 'holy shit' in here."

Jeremy looked at Nils.  "When did it happen?"

"Four years ago.  Like you, like most of us, I ran away from home.  When I came back a week later my mother and father didn't know who I was."

"My--"  Jeremy caught himself and felt his cheeks tingle.  He looked at Aaron.  "My goodness."

Aaron laughed and put his hand on Jeremy's shoulder.  "I'm sorry, Jeremy.  I was joking about watching your words.  You don't have to be that careful around here.  You'll be blurting out all kinds of blasphemy over the next few days.  It's expected."
