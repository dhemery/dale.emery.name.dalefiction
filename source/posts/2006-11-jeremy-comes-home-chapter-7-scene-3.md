Though Jeremy could not see it in the dark, he knew that Mount Shasta lay straight ahead.  The family had drive up Interstate 5 from Sacramento to Portland seven years ago.  Mom had packed their best clothes, loaded them all into the car, and driven them the four hundred miles to a wedding for an old college girlfriend.  Dad had not come.  He could not break away from work.  Mom had fumed non-stop until five-year-old Jeremy had pointed to a dim, cone shape ahead and asked, "Mom, what's that?"

"That's Mount Shasta," she had said.

"Is it a mountain?"

"Of course, you idiot," Gil said.  "What do you think Mount Shasta is?  A lake?"

"It's pretty small."

Gil said, "Idiot."

Mom said, "It's a long way away.  Keep watching."

Jeremy had watched.  And watched.  And watched some more.  For miles and miles the mountain lay straight ahead, growing imperceptibly mile by mile.

Jeremy remembered the miles and miles, what seemed like hours and hours, that it had taken to reach Shasta.

Now, seven years later, he knew that had time to think.  He didn't want to think, but he had too much time, and nothing else to do but think.

There was the obvious question.  How had his entire family forgotten him?  No, not his entire family...  And how had the newspaper story changed?  Mild-mannered Christian fracking Cavezos.

Foley had been trying to figure that out for fifty years.  Fifty years!  Would this be any easier to accept after fifty years?

But there were other questions.  How did Foley remember him?  And how did Aaron remember him?  When everyone else had forgotten him, how had Aaron and Foley remembered?

And how had Aaron found him?

Jeremy had no answers.  The small questions swirled in his mind.  He supposed that could not fathom the big question, so his mind kindly focused on smaller things.

Smaller things, but puzzling.

Jeremy saw lights ahead, some kind of roadside sign, a marquee, probably warning travelers about road work ahead.  Jeremy squinted, wanting something to take his mind off the insanity of the past three days--had it been only three days?--but he could not yet read the words.

The bus sped up the interstate and the sign came closer.

Now the words came into view, a long message scrolling in bright white lights up the sign.
