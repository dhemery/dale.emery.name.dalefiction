Jeremy's stomach growled as he walked.  He had money--a little more than thirty two dollars--but he didn't want to spend it yet.  He wasn't sure when he would have more.  He hadn't yet learned the easiest places to steal money.  So he would have to find free food.

He walked along Fortin Street toward downtown.  There was a strip of three stores at Saint Laurent.  A year ago the middle store was Fishety-Chips fish and chips restaurant.  There would be a dumpster there.  And at four in the afternoon there would be scraps from lunch.  And a smaller chance of bumping into someone working there.

Yes, there it was, still there.

Jeremy went around the side of the first store, Finnie's Gourmet Hardware.  Jeremy remembered that Finnie's was overstuffed with every item you could ever need.  Whenever they needed a washer or a bolt or a hook or some doodad around the house, off Jeremy would go to Finnie's to ask, "Say, do you happen to have --?"

After a half dozen trips, Jeremy stopped being surprised when the clerk would walk into the back room and instantly return with exactly the washer or hook or bolt that Jeremy had asked for.

Jeremy had told his mother that he wanted to grow up and work for Finnie's.

"What on earth do you want to do that for?" she had replied.

"Because it's the only way I'll ever get to see what magic they use in the back room to conjure up left-handed, grade A, fine threaded wing-nuts."

Natalie didn't get the joke.

Now Jeremy noted that he had never been as close to that back room as he was this minute.  But he was outside, not inside, sneaking rather than marveling.

Behind Finnie's was a small alley, as Jeremy had expected.  And as he expected, it was dusty and greasy from both Fishety's deep fryer and whatever magical things went in and out of the back door to Finnie's.  There were two old cars, a Hyundai and a Toyota pickup truck.

And there behind Fishety's back door was the dumpster, blue and stained.  The dumpster lid was open, and the door to Fishety's was closed.  Jeremy took this as an invitation.

Jeremy stepped up on a wooden palette that lay beside the dumpster.  The smell of old grease assaulted him.  His stomach writhed.  The edge of the dumpster was chest high, and Jeremy could see discarded plates covered with slimy catsup and tartar sauce.  He caught a whiff of french fries soaked in malt vinegar and nearly swooned.

There along the bottom edge of the dumpster was a package of dinner rolls.  It looked as if it had not been opened.

Jeremy's mouth began to water.  Mr. Fishety might care about expiration dates, but Jeremy did not.

He hopped on the palette and threw himself forward so that his stomach lay on the top edge of the dumpster.  He leaned forward and thrust his legs back for balance.  He stretched his hand toward the dinner rolls, but could not quite reach.  Damn, he would have to jump into the dumpster.

One more try.  Jeremy stretched his arm as far as he could.

The door to Fishety's opened and someone grunted.  Jeremy scrambled to right himself, but a back of garbage hit him in the back, knocking him forward and into the swamp of chunks and slop.

"Hey!" a voice yelled, a boy's voice.

Jeremy sat up in the slime and looked up.  Peering over the edge of the dumpster was Aiden Corliss.

Jeremy knew Aiden.  They had gone to different schools, but they played on the same little league team the summer before last.

"What are you doing in the dumpster?"

"I'm filing my taxes.  What are you doing here?"

"I work here."

"They let twelve-year-olds work in restaurants now?"

"My dad owns the place.  How did you know how old I am?"

Jeremy suddenly doubted his memory.

"You're Aidan Corliss, right?"

"Yeah.  How do I know you?"

"We played baseball together in little league.  Jason's Computers.  Remember?"

"No, uh uh.  You were on Jason's Computers?"

"Yes, last year.  We won the east Sacramento championship.  Remember?  Hey, give me a hand."

Jeremy reached his hand toward Aidan.

Aidan hesitated, then gripped Jeremy by the wrist.  Jeremy put his other hand on the edge of the dumpster and Aidan pulled.  Jeremy's sneaker slipped on the grease and condiments, and he landed on his ribs with a whoof.

Aidan pulled harder and Jeremy scrambled over the top.  Aidan looked at his hand in disgust, then back at Jeremy.

"Sorry, man," Jeremy said.  He looked at his clothes and began to brush the sludge and napkins and bits of food off with both hands.

Jeremy looked up at Aidan.

Aidan held his hand away from his body, as if he didn’t want it to touch his clothes.

Jeremy straightened and held his hands out to the side.

"Remember me now?"

"You mean you played little league all covered with crap?"

"No, asswipe.  I mean now that you can see me better.  I used to be a little shorter and a little heavier."

"Jeremy, you said?"

"Yeah."

"No, sorry.  I don't remember any Jeremy on Jason's Computers."

"We won the championship last year."

"And this year," Aidan said.  "Two years running.  We're a regular dynasty.  But I don't remember any Jeremy on the team."

"What about the last game, the championship game?  Remember?  Against Kinko's.  We were up by one run in the last inning, and all we had to do was keep them from scoring.  Jimmy Tremblay came up with two guys on base and one out.  He swing at the first pitch and hit a grounder so hard I didn't even see it.  I was playing third base, and I just stuck my glove out.  Somehow the ball smacked into my glove, and somehow my glove stayed on.  I stepped on third base and threw to first, way high.  Manny Tucker jumped and caught it.  Jimmy was so stunned that he stood gawking in the batter's box.  Double play.  A miracle double play that won the game."

Aidan stared at Jeremy with his mouth open.

"Now do you remember?"

"I remember everything about it," said Aidan.  "You're right, that was a freaking miracle."

"Then you remember me!"

"I remember Christian Cavezos."

<u>Christian--  Oh my God.</u>  "What are you talking about?"

"What are <u>you</u> talking about?  You trying to take Christian's one moment of glory away from him?"

"Christian Cavezos was a second string infielder.  Coach Irwin would never have put Christian in the field at a moment like that!"  Jeremy threw up his arms in frustration.

Aidan stepped back.  "Hey, take it easy."

"Christian freaking Cavezos?  Christian ducked every time a batter swung."

"Sure he sucked, but he's all we had," Aidan said.  "That's what made the play such a miracle."

"But it was in the newspaper," Jeremy shouted.  "My name was in the newspaper."

Aidan blinked.  "You got to get help, man.  Eating out of dumpsters and stealing the glory from a kid who never had a shining moment and probably never will again."

Jeremy's mind screamed, <u>No, no, no!</u>

"Aidan!  It's me!  Jeremy Crowther!"

"Hey, if you say so.  You need help, Jeremy."

Aidan turned to go into the restaurant.

In sudden desperation, Jeremy grabbed him by the wrist.  "Aidan, no.  Aidan talk to me.  Aidan!"

“Let go of me, you freak!”  Aidan jerked his wrist free and quickly stepped inside and slammed the door violently.

<u>My God!  My God!  What is wrong with everybody?</u>

Jeremy fell to his knees.  He spread his arms out to the sides and let his head fall back.

"What is happening?" he screamed at the indifferent afternoon sky.  "What in the deep blue fuck is going on!"
