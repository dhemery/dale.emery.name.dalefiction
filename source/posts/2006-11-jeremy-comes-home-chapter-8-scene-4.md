Patty stood looking down at Terry, with her foot on the seat of the chair and her forarm draped across on her knee.  "You're involved with Aaron Crowther?"

"Yeah, he's a friend of mine.  He used to work for me in Portland a few years ago.  I ran a used CD store."

"How does Jeremy fit in with all of this?"

"When I moved to Sacramento, Aaron asked me to keep an eye on his family.  Just check up on them every once in a while and report back.  When you told me about that kid who was poking around his house, Jeremy, I called Aaron to let him know."

"And you didn't think to tell me any of this?"

"I didn't know it was a big deal.  At that point it was just some kid bothering Aaron's family.  I didn't know it was going to blow up like this."

Patty sighed and shook her head.  "And what did Aaron say when you told him about the boy coming to his family's house?"

"He thought the kid might be his brother."

"'Might be?'  What does that mean?"

"It's complicated.  I--"

"You mean like a step-brother or a half brother?"

"More like a former brother."

Former brother?  What did that mean?  Disowned?  Patty didn't think that's what Terry meant.  "You're not making much sense, Terry.  You probably want to start making more sense now."

Terry rubbed his cheek with his fingers and worked his jaw.  "Believe me, if I know how to make this make sense I would."

How much more bizarre could this whole incident get?  "Try."

"Aaron..."  Terry licked his lips and swallowed.  "He works with... kids..."  He looked down and paused.

"Works with kids?  What kids?"

"Kids who... uh... whose families don't remember them."  Terry looked up at Patty like a kid who had just told his mother that he wasn't doing nothing, that the lamp "just broke."

<font color="#3366ff">[NOTE:  For reasons that will become clear, this next bit didn't work.  So I crossed it out.]<strike></strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    Patty tilted her head to the side.  That didn't make sense.  He must have said it wrong.  "What do you mean?  Kids with amnesia?"</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    "No, it's more like the other way around.  The kids remember their families, but their families don't remember them."</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    "You mean like street kids?"</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    "Well, they're usually street kids, but that's not what I mean.  I don't mean that the families don't want to know about these kids.  I mean that the families..."</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    "Yes?"</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    "The families just don't remember that the kid ever existed."</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    "The whole family forgets?"</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    "Well, that's the thing.  Everybody forgets them.  It's as if they never existed."</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    "That doesn't make sense, Terry."</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    Terry jerked back as if he expected a blow.  "That's what I said.  It doesn't make sense."</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    "And Aaron 'works with' these kids?  How does he work with them?"</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    "He counsels them.  When they find out nobody knows who they are, they freak out.  They can't handle it.  So Aaron talks to them, talks them through it.  Introduces them to other kids like them."</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    "Others like them?  How many of these kids are there?"</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff"><strike>    "I don't know.  Two years ago, just before I moved down here, there were maybe a dozen.  There are more now.  Probably twenty or thirty, but I don't know for sure."</strike></font>

<font color="#3366ff">[NOTE:  Whoops.  Patty is acting here as if she's never heard this crazy story before.  But she has heard Jeremy's nearly identical crazy story.  Scrap that and try again.]</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    Patty tried to turn Terry's words around in her mind so that they made sense.  He meant that the kids forgot their families, that they had amnesia.</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    But when she tried to twist the words, Jeremy's voice twisted them back again.  <u>They didn't know who I was.  My mother said she didn't have a son named Jeremy.</u>  It hadn't made sense when Jeremy said it, and it didn't make sense when Terry said it.  But sensible or not, the story was similar.</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Their whole family forgets them?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "And not just their family, but everybody else, too.  Everybody."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    Jeremy's whole family.  And his friend from the baseball team.  And a year-old newspaper story.  Two crazy stories, too close to be coincidence.  Patty decided to press Terry a little further, to see if she could shake him from the story.  "Terry, I told you to start making sense.  You're not making sense."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "I know," Terry said, his voice thin.  "That's what I've been saying.  It doesn't make sense.  It's crazy."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    Time to spring the trap.  "But it's not the first time I've heard this story."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "What?  You mean you--"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "I mean I heard it from Jeremy on Saturday night.  And then I told you.  But it was shit when Jeremy told it, and shit when I told you, and shit now as you shovel it back at me."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "You--  You think I'm just telling you the story you told me?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "That's the only way that makes any sense."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "No, I've seen those kids.  In Portland."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Kids whose entire families have forgotten them."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Yeah.  When I was there, there were maybe a dozen.  Aaron works with them.  They get pretty freaked out when they find out that nobody knows them.  Aaron helps them.  He talks them through it."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    Terry narrowed her eyes and bit her lip.  "You sound as if you believe this nonsense."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "It ain't nonsense.  I've seen it with my own eyes."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Seen it?  How do know that their families forgot them?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Wha--"  Terry's eyes darted around as if the answer to Patty's question were scribbled on a wall but he couldn't remember where.  "The kids.  They told about how they tried to go home."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Go home?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Yeah, these kids are runaways."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Like Jeremy."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Like Jeremy.  They run away from home, and when they go back nobody remembers them.  I've heard the stories they tell."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Like the story that Jeremy told me?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Exactly!  Exactly like that.  But, honest, I heard it in Portland two years ago, from lots of kids, way before you told me what Jeremy said.  These kids go home and nobody remembers them.  It really fucks them up."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    All runaways, Patty thought.  And all telling the same impossible story.  Again, this could not be coincidence.  That is, if Terry was telling the truth.  What was the connection?</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "How old are these kids?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Teenagers, I guess.  Usually older than Jeremy.  He's the youngest I've seen."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Are they all younger than Aaron?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    Terry eyes scanned left to right in small steps as if he were counting the pickets in a fence.  "Yeah, I think so.  I'm pretty sure.  A couple of years younger."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Impressionable?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Impression--"  Terry's face blanked for a moment.  Then his eyes focused and he looked at Patty.  "Jesus.  You think Aaron..."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Finish your thought."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "You think Aaron is fucking with those kids, don't you?  Messing with their heads."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    Patty nodded.  "Yes I do.  A dozen kids, all young enough to be impressionable, all vulnerable because they're away from their families, all telling the same impossible story after hanging around with this older, wiser guy.  Sounds like a cult to me."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "A cult?  Aaron?  Jesus.  But he's just a kid, himself."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "How would you describe his personality?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Friendly...  Cheerful...  Wiser than his years..."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Charismatic?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Yeah, I guess that sums it up.  He's a likeable kid."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "With a dark side?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Not that I ever saw."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "But could be?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "I don't know..."  Terry's eyes shifted around as if he were examining mental images.  "I wouldn't have thought--  Aaron--"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Let's take your friend out of the picture for a minute and imagine someone else working with those runaway kids.  Then what do you think of my theory?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    Terry considered the question.  "It makes more sense than what I said.  A hell of a lot more sense."</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    It didn't explain everything.  There were a lot of details that didn't yet fit, that Patty could not yet make sense of.  If Jeremy had already been brainwashed, why had he come to Sacramento?  Why had he specifically chosen Aaron's family to latch onto?  Why had he reacted as if this were all new information?</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    And if Jeremy had not already been brainwashed, why was he telling the same bizarre story that--if Terry could be believed--a dozen other children had been brainwashed to tell?</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    Jeremy did not fit the theory.  The general shape of Jeremy's story fit, but the details did not.</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    And what was Foley's part in all of this?</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    No, Patty's theory didn't explain everything.  But it made far more sense than Jeremy's story.  And Terry's.</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    Patty would have to patch up the theory later.  But at the moment she had something else she wanted to do.</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "Terry, does your phone have GPS capability?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "I think so.  I never turned it on, though.  Why?"</font>

<font color="#3366ff">    "I want you to call your phone company."</font>
