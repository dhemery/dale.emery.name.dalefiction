Once again, Aaron was frantic, pacing faster than usual, changing direction randomly, talking with exaggerated motions of his hands.  And yelling.

"Jesus, Nils, Foley talked to Gil."

"Gil?  What does he want with Gil?"

"He gave Gil my phone number.  Gil called me."

Nils didn't know what to say.  He'd always wondered why Aaron hadn't made contact with his family, at least to let them know he was okay.

"How did that go?"

"A complete mess.  I wasn't prepared.  All I could think about was the hell does Foley think he's doing."

"What else did Gil say?"

"Nothing.  Jesus, I didn't give him a chance.  I think I hung up on him."

"What?  What did you do that for?"

"I panicked, Nils.  Foley is stirring up my family even more than Jeremy is.  I can understand why Jeremy did what he did.  But why Foley?  Why is he even involved in this?"

"Maybe it has something to do with his remembering Jeremy."

Aaron abruptly stopped pacing and stared at Nils.  "My God, you're right.  He remembers Jeremy.  And he remembers my mother.  He talked to her after Jeremy ran away."  Aaron sat on a folding chair.  "Maybe he thinks he can help my family remember Jeremy."

"Maybe he can."

Aaron's mouth dropped open.  He blinked and looked up at Nils.  "Jesus, Nils.  What if he can?"

"And what if he can help all of these kids?"

Aaron shook his head as if shaking away cobwebs.  "What would that even do?"

"It would give us what we've been working for.  Aaron, all of these kids could finally go home."

Aaron jumped up and stared blankly.  Then he resumed his random pacing.

"Aaron, this might be just what we've been looking for."

"We're making an awful big leap, Nils.  All we know is that he remembers Jeremy, and that he's... contacted my family."

"Well, that's more than we've ever had before.  Nobody has ever remembered a Forgotten before."

"No, nobody ever has."

"So clearly something is different about Foley."

"I have a bad feeling about him, Nils."

"I can understand that.  He insinuated himself into your family, and he's stirring them up.  Maybe we should get him up here."

"What?  No."  Aaron looked shocked.  "Why would he even come?"

"To help Jeremy.  To meet Jeremy's brother.  To help Jeremy's brother to remember."

Aaron thought for a moment.  "That's good, Nils.  That's a good idea."

"And maybe we can figure out what's special about him.  Maybe he already knows."

"Let's not get our hopes up, Nils."

"But let's not let go of hope, either."
