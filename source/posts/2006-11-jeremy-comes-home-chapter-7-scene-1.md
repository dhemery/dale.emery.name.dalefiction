The first thing Officer Patricia Yonce noticed when she entered Page Foley's house was the half-eaten sandwich on the kitchen counter and the sweating, half-full mug of root beer beside it.

Officer Norman Pierce emerged from the hallway.  "Clear," he said.

Before entering the house they had checked the driveway and the street.  Foley's car, a dark blue 2002 Camry, had been nowhere in sight.

Foley had not appeared at the station.  At ten minutes after four, Andollo had called in the warrant as Yonce and Pierce headed for Foley's house.

The half-eaten lunch--or lunches, as Yonce discovered as she entered the kitchen--indicated flight.

Yonce said, "Check the garage.  I'll look around in here."

Pierce nodded and left.

Yonce entered the living room.  On the coffee table were two pieces of paper.  One, a old, yellowed newspaper clipping, showed three young men in military dress caps.  Yonce didn't recognize any of the men or their names.

She looked at the other piece of paper and a chill ran down her back before she consciously recognized what she was seeing.  It was a home-made missing person poster for a boy named Paul Quinn.

Yonce remembered Quinn.  He had gone missing a year earlier.  He had not been found.

A year ago...  Sweet Jesus.  Twelve-year-old Paul Quinn had gone missing last October.  Within days Foley had called to inquire about another missing boy, a boy nobody had heard of named Jeremy Crowther.

"Oh, dear sweet Jesus," Yonce whispered as she reached for her phone.

"Patty!" Pierce's voice came from outside, from the direction of the garage.  "I've got something."

Yonce ran.  Pierce pointed to a spot in the back of the garage.  Two suitcases sat on a shelf.  Between them was an empty space about the size of another suitcase.

Yonce dialed rapidly, muttering, "My God, my god..."

Answer the phone, Ray.  Answer the damned phone!

"Andollo!"

"Ray, they're gone!  They're gone!"

"All right.  I'm going to call it, Patty.  See what you can find in the house."  Andollo hung up.

Patty stood staring at the open cell phone in her hand.

I've fucked this one up, she thought.  Oh my God have I fucked this up.
