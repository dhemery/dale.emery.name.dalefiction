Officer Raymond Andollo opened the door to the interrogation room and entered with a can of Sprite and an egg salad sandwich in a triangular plastic package.  He set them on the bare metal table in front of Jeremy.

Jeremy ripped the package open, pulled out one of the sandwich halves and stuffed most of it into his mouth.  As he chewed he opened the can of Sprite.

"Hungry," Andollo said.

"Like I said," Jeremy replied.

Andollo sat in a metal chair opposite Jeremy and watched the boy down the sandwich in four bites, each washed down with gulps of soda.

"Thank you," Jeremy said.

"Is that going to be enough?  You want another one?"

"No, that will hold me for a while."

"Let me know if you need anything else."

Andollo leaned back casually and stroked the four day growth of his mustache with the index finger of his right hand.  He studied Jeremy with narrowed eyes, a puzzle to be solved.

Jeremy sat with his hands folded on the table and returned Officer Andollo's gaze.

They sat this way for several minutes.

Andollo broke the silence.

"Jeremy Crowther."

"Yes, sir."

"While I was outside I checked some things.  Yesterday we received a complaint from Natalie Crowther.  She said some hooligan has been harassing her and her family.  That's what she said.  'Hooligan.'"

Jeremy didn't know what to say.

Andollo continued.  "Are you a hooligan, Jeremy?"

"No, sir."

"You've been on the street for a while."

"Yes, sir.  A year.  In San Francisco."

"What kind of trouble did you get in there?"

"I stayed out of trouble, mostly.  Sometimes mall security guards didn't like me scrambling around in the garbage cans, but that's about it."

"No drugs?"

"No way.  No, sir."

"Perverted old men?"

"No, sir, none of that.  I knew some kids...  But I stayed away from that."

"Sometimes kids on the street are unlucky, Jeremy.  Not everybody is lucky enough to stay out of that kind of trouble."

"I know.  Like I said, I knew some kids.  And a few times things were pretty hard...  But I got through okay."

"Shoplifting?"

Jeremy put his hands in his lap and looked down at them.  "Sometimes, I guess."

"Never got caught?"

"Once.  But I talked myself out of trouble."

"You're pretty good with words."

"I guess."

"Did you ever steal money?"

"Sometimes.  You get hungry, you know?"

"Sure.  You do what you have to do."

Andollo squinted at Jeremy and pursed his lips.

"Why were you bothering Mrs. Crowther and her kids?"

Jeremy squirmed in his chair.  What could he say?  If he told the truth, they'd throw him into an asylum.

"Jeremy, puking on a computer in a library is not a crime.  Yelling and screaming and scaring the bookworms might be disturbing the peace, I suppose, but I don't think that's a big deal.  But harassing kids, that's a big deal.  That's a big deal."

Jeremy looked up at Officer Andollo.  "I won't be bothering them any more."

"That's good, Jeremy.  That's a start.  What I'd like to know is why you were bothering them in the first place."

"You're not going to drop this, are you?"

"No, Jeremy.  I'm not going to drop it."

Jeremy took a long breath.

"This is going to sound crazy."

"I hear eighteen crazy things a day.  I'm trained in advanced sanity maintenance.  I'm due for my yearly refresher course."

Jeremy laughed.  "They have room for a twelve year old kid?"

Andollo smiled and waited.  Gently he said, "Tell me."

Jeremy looked Andollo in the eye.  "They're my family."

"Your family."

"Natalie is my mother.  Gil is my brother.  Deena--  Nadine is my sister.  I had an older brother named Aaron, but he ran away after 9/11.  I..."

"You what, Jeremy?"

"Like I told you before.  I ran away.  Last year.  I've been in San Francisco."

"And on Thursday you took a bus to Sacramento."

"I wanted to come home.  To go home.  I don't know how to say it now."

"You don't know how to say it?"

"I..."

"Take your time."

"I don't know a way to say it so that it doesn't sound crazy."

"That's okay.  Say it crazy, then."

"They didn't know who I was."

"The Crowthers."

Jeremy looked at Officer Andollo.  "They said they didn't know any Jeremy."

"That's what Mrs. Crowther's complaint said.  A kid was harassing her and claiming to be her son Jeremy."

Jeremy could think of nothing to say.

"She says she doesn't have a son named Jeremy."

Jeremy began to cry.

"It seems to me, Jeremy, that Mrs. Crowther isn't likely to be mistaken about something like that."

"I know that!" Jeremy yelled, jumping up and knocking his chair over behind him.

Officer Andollo stood calmly and pointed with an upturned hand toward the chair.

Jeremy looked at the chair for a moment, then set it upright and sat down.

Across the table, Andollo sat.

"Jeremy, tell me a story that makes sense."

"I don't have a story that makes sense.  Honest to God, I don't."

"Is this how you got out of trouble in San Francisco?"

"Is what how I got out of trouble?"

"Telling stories."

"Officer Andollo, does this seem like the kind of story that would get me out of trouble?"

"Good point.  But let me ask you a question.  Did you ever read Silas Marner?"

"What?"

"Silas Marner."

"The book by George Eliot?  About the guy who finds a baby on his doorstep?"

"That's the one.  Did you ever read it?"

"Yeah, a couple of years ago.  What does--  You think I'm an orphan hoping the Crowthers will adopt me?"

"What?" Andollo said, puzzled.  "Oh, I see.  No, that's not what I meant."

"Then what does Silas Marner have to do with me?"

Andollo laughed.  "It's my long-winded way of making a point.  Bear with me.  The thing is, I never read the book.  I was supposed to read it, in ninth grade, but I didn't.  Then we had a test about the plot and the characters and the theme and the symbolism.  I didn't have a clue.  So I made up a story instead, and then answered the test questions as if they were about the story I'd made up.  Some outrageous thing about Martians distilling peach hooch during the Civil War.  Mrs. Branscomb gave me a C on the test, for creativity."

Jeremy thought for a moment, then said, "I get it."

"Tell me."

"I'm good with words.  So if I get into trouble, all I have to do is make up a crazy story.  If it's outrageous enough, I get points for cleverness and get out of trouble.  Is that about right?"

"Well?"

"I'll bet you're also trained in advanced bull shit detection."  Jeremy blushed.  "Sir."

Andollo laughed.  "Good guess."

"And my story seems like ..."  Jeremy decided not to say the word again.

"Smells like bull shit."

"And you're not Mrs. Branscomb."

"No, I'm not Mrs. Branscomb.  You're going to need a better story."

Jeremy looked at his hands.

Officer Andollo asked, "Were you in the house?"

"What?"

"Mrs. Crowther says she believes you were in the house.  Have you been in the house?"

Knowing it sounded foolish, Jeremy said, "I grew up in that house."

"With a mother and brother and sister who don't know who you are."

"It doesn't make much sense, I guess."

"I guess it doesn't."

Andollo and Jeremy waited in silence, each for the other to speak.  Neither spoke.

Finally, Andollo said, "If I checked the house, would I find your fingerprints?"

"I don't know."

"What do you mean you don't know?"

"How long do fingerprints last?"

"You were in the house, then."

"Yes, I was in the house.  I already told you that."

"When you lived there."

"I haven't been in there in a year.  Do fingerprints last that long?"

"Unlikely.  So we wouldn't find any recent fingerprints?"

"No."

"How did you get in?"

"I had a key."

"A key."

"Yes, a key.  You might have heard of it.  You put it in the lock and turn it and the lock opens.  We all had keys."

Andollo mocked bored impatience.  "Don't be a smartass, Jer--"

"Fingerprints!"

"What's that?"

"In fourth grade, two officers came to Mr. Hewitt's class and we all had our fingerprints taken."

"Mr. Hewitt?  You know Doug Hewitt?"

"Yes, he was my fourth grade teacher."

Andollo narrowed his eyes.

Jeremy continued.  "Do you have those fingerprints on file?"

"Yes.  Us, the state police, the FBI."

"Take my fingerprints, then.  Match them up in your files.  That will tell you who I am."

Andollo rubbed his mustache.

"How about if we try it the easy way?  I'll just go look up your fingerprints by name."

"Even better," Jeremy said.  "That's even better."

Officer Andollo stood up.  "What name?"

"Jeremy Crowther!  How many times do I have to tell you?"

"You're sure that's how you want to do this?"

"Yes."

"What year was that?"

"Fourth grade.  I don't remember whether it was early in the school year or late.  Either 2004 or 2005."

"I'll just be a minute," Andollo said, and walked out of the room.

Jeremy wondered, what if they don't match?  What if, God forbid, his fingerprints matched Christian freaking Cavezos?

Andollo appeared in the door.

Jeremy said, "That was quick."

"I asked Officer Yonce to locate your card.  She'll let us know when she finds it."

"Okay."

"While we're waiting, I have some questions about the library."

"I'm sorry about that."

"I'm sure you are.  You stirred up trouble at two different branches.  You left two librarians in a bit of a panic, not to mention a dozen or so customers."

"I don't know what to--"

"Poor Nora Templeman said she held you for five full minutes while you screamed uncontrollably.  When Officer Graham tried to take you from her arms you threw up on the computer."

Andollo paused, as if waiting for a response.

Jeremy remembered the librarian holding him.  He had felt so embarrassed that he wanted to run, but he could not bring himself to pull away.  He felt comforted to be held, even by a stranger, and that embarrassed him even more.  He had acted like a child, being held like that.  And he could not bring himself to ask her to stop holding him.

"That's not normal behavior for a twelve year old."

Jeremy felt heat rising in the skin of his neck and his ears.  How could he explain?

A red haired woman in an officer's uniform--Officer Yonce, Jeremy presumed--rapped lightly on the doorway twice.  Andollo looked up and Yonce shook her head.

"Thank you," Andollo said, and Officer Yonce turned and left.

"You didn't find my fingerprints," Jeremy said.

"No."

"So what happens now?"

"Right now, Jeremy, I need to figure out what to do with you.  In the past three days you've harassed the Crowthers three times, torn up two libraries, sent two librarians into therapy, and, if what you told me is true, poisoned a public fountain."

"I didn't poison it.  I just washed my clothes in it."

"I'm exaggerating for effect, Jeremy.  You know something about that."

Jeremy sighed.  "It doesn't make sense, I know.  I don't blame you for not believing me."

Officer Andollo smiled.  "But that still leaves the question.  What should I do with you?"

"I promise not to bother Mom-- the Crowthers again.  I promise."

"I could put you in a juvie cell overnight.  Or I could call social services..." Andollo let this idea hang in the air.

Jeremy considered these possibilities.  A cell for the night didn't sound so bad, as long as they would let him go in the morning.  He didn't know what social services might do with him, and he didn't want to find out.

Andollo said, with mild surprise, "You're considering this, aren't you?"

"Does the cell come with meals?"

Andollo's head tilted slightly to the side.  "Wait here for a minute," he said, and stood up and left the room.

Jeremy considered his options.  Did he really want to spend the night in a jail cell?  He'd spent nights in worse places.

He was sure he didn't want to get caught up in social services.  They would probably send him to some shrink who would ask him all kinds of questions that he wouldn't dare answer honestly.  And would they keep him in some kind of lockup while they figured out what to do with him, or would he be free to come and go?

Or maybe he should just bolt right now, while Officer Andollo was out of the room...

Andollo came into the room holding two plastic bags.  "Sandwiches," he said, nodding toward the bag in his right hand.  He nodded to the other.  "Soda."

He handed the bags to Jeremy.

Jeremy couldn't believe his luck.

"Thank you, Officer Andollo.  I mean it.  Thank you very much."  Jeremy turned toward his backpack, which lay on the floor behind his chair, and reached for the zipper.

"Just one thing," Andollo said.

Jeremy cringed and stopped mid-zip, waiting for the hammer to fall.

"Do you have a place to stay for the night?"

"He'll be coming home with me," said a man's voice from the direction of the door.

Jeremy whirled and lost his balance, landing on his backpack and sending the two bags of food skittering across the cold cement floor.

There in the doorway stood Officer Yonce and the old man from the park.  The old man from the library.

"And who would you be?"

"My name is Page Foley," said the old man.  "I'm his grandfather."

Jeremy stared open mouthed, unable to breathe.  His grandfather?  Jeremy had never seen this man until two days ago.

Or, at least, he didn't remember seeing him before.

Andollo looked at Jeremy, who glanced at him and then turned back to Foley.  Dreamily, he said, "My grandfather."

"This man is your grandfather?"

"Well..." Jeremy said, stalling for time.  If this guy was really his grandfather, then he needed to know.  He needed to know what had happened to his memory, to his sanity.

Jeremy needed more time to think.

"What are you doing here?"

"I was listening to the police scanner in the den," Foley said.  "There was a call about a kid making a commotion in the library.  You said you were going to the library.  When you didn't come home, I figured it was you."

Jesus.  None of that had happened.  Foley--if that was his real name--was in the library when Jeremy was there.  Maybe this was some kind of scam.  One thing was for sure, Foley was quick on his feet.

Jeremy decided to play along.  It would get him out of here, and he knew that once they were out of the police station he could get away from Foley whenever he wanted to.

"Mr. Foley, I'm Ray Andollo.  You're this boy's grandfather?"

"Yes, sir, Officer Andollo.  I apologize if he's been any trouble for you.  He said he was taking his meds, but--"

"What's his name?"

Foley looked at Jeremy with a look of mild scorn.  "Has he been calling himself Jeremy again?"

"Yes, that's right.  What is his real name?"

Before Foley could answer, Jeremy blurted, "Toby!"

Foley looked at Jeremy, then back at Andollo.  "His name is Toby--"

"It's short for October."

Andollo and Foley both looked at Jeremy, Foley with an expression that said, "What are you doing?"

Andollo said, "Did you say, 'October?'"

Before Jeremy could speak, Foley said, "His mother was a bit of a free spirit, Officer."

Andollo raised an eyebrow.  "Was?"

"She died a year ago, sir.  In Chicago.  An accident.  She was taking her daughter and her other son to the dentist.  The roads were slippery from an icy rain, and they were hit broadside by a semi truck."

Jesus, Jeremy thought.  None of this was true.  None a word of it.  This guy was good.  A little too good.

Andollo said, "October Foley?"

"No, Iverson.  Toby Iverson.  His mother was my daughter."

"He's been bothering a family in East Sacramento."

Foley looked at Jeremy with a look of resignation.  "Toby's a good kid, Officer.  He's gone off his meds a few times and it's hard for him.  It's hard for him to accept that his mother and brother and sister are gone."

Andollo looked back and forth from Jeremy to Foley.

"Officer, he's a good kid.  He didn't mean any trouble."

"How often does he go off his meds?"

"This is only the third time.  It's been almost nine months since the last time.  I'll be more vigilant.  His therapist says he is making great progress."

Jeremy said, "Grampa, do we need to tell them all of that?"

"Toby, we're going tell them whatever they need to know."

Foley turned to Andollo.

"What else do you need to know, Officer Andollo?"

Andollo looked thoughtfully at Foley for a moment.  "Just some formalities.  Officer Yonce here can take care of those.  And we'll have some paperwork for you."

"Thank you, officer."

Jeremy said, "Thank you, sir."

"Mr. Foley, can you keep Toby out of trouble?"

"Yes, sir, I can.  I think I can."
