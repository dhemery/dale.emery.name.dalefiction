On top of the monitor sat a bobble head doll of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Printed on the plastic base were the words "The Governator."

Officer Patricia Yonce looked at the screen and frowned.  She reached for her telephone and dialed five digits.

"Andollo."

"Ray, I think we've got trouble."

"What is it?"

"I ran Page Foley through a search.  The phone logs have an entry from a year ago.  He called in asking whether we had a missing person report for a Jeremy Crowther."

"Jesus," Andollo said.  "Did we?"

"Crowther?  No.  There's an Aaron Crowther from six years ago.  Runaway.  No followup.  But nothing for Jeremy."

"You have a theory?"

"Not yet.  Still searching."

"What did you find out about Foley's daughter in Chicago?"

"Well, that's another puzzle.  Meredith Iverson was killed on the interstate in Plainfield, Illinois, just outside of Chicago.  Also killed were a son, Matthew, and a daughter, Andrea."

"So Foley's story checks out?"

"Well, sort of.  The obit says 'Ms. Iverson is survived by her father, Page Foley of Sacramento, California.'  But here's the weird thing.  There's no mention of a surviving son named Toby or October."

"How about Jeremy?"

"No, no Jeremy either."

"Shit.  What the hell are those two up to?"

"I have a bad feeling about this, Ray," Yonce said.  "A real bad feeling."
