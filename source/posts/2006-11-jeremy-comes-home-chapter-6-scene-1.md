<em>NOTE:  The last two or three days have been a slog.  Today, finally, the writing felt good.  This scene had some nice surprises for me.</em>

Nadine Crowther tried to carry the saucer, spoon, and full tea cup in one hand while holding the photo album tucked under her other arm.  As she crossed the threshold into her mother's bedroom the photo album slipped slightly.  She tighted the grip with her arm, jerking her body slightly, which jiggled her hand so that some of the tea sloshed into the saucer

"What are you doing, Nadine," Natalie Crowther said from the bed, her voice flat.

Nadine stood as still as she could, trying to keep her attention on both the tea and the photo album.  Slowly she moved toward the bed.

Her mother lay on the bed with a tea tray across her middle.  Beside her lay a small pile of magazines that had not moved since Nadine had laid them there three hours earlier.

As Nadine reached to set the tea saucer on the tray, her attention left the photo album.  She lost her grip and the binder crashed to the floor beside the bed.  The tea sloshed again as the saucer hit the tray and came to rest.

"Nadine!" Natalie said.

Nadine expected to be scolded further, but her mother focused now on the tea.

As Nadine bent to pick up the photo album, her hair cast dim shadows in the feeble light of the bedside lamp.

The impact had sprung the binder rings open, and when Nadine picked up the binder several leaves fell out.

"Thank you, dear," Natalie said.

Nadine lay the splayed binder on the bed near her mother's feet and bent to pick up the fallen leaves.

"What are you doing down there, honey?"

"I was wondering something," Nadine said.  In the photo leaf that lay face up in her hand were four photographs.  One of them showed black and white image of a beaming boy standing on the shore of a lake.  In one hand he held a fishing pole.  From his other hand dangled a tiny black shapeless thing that Nadine imagined must be a fish.

Nadine slid the leaf in front of her mother and pointed to the picture of the boy.  "How old was Dad here?"

"Nadine, you know I don't like to talk about your father."

Nadine frowned and slumped.  After a moment she stepped toward the foot of the bed where the binder lay.

"Oh, Nadine, stop pouting.  Let me see that," Natalie said.  She held out her hand and wiggled her fingers.

Nadine placed the leaf in her mother's hands and pointed to the photo.

Natalie studied the picture.  "I don't know dear.  Eleven or twelve, maybe.  Why do you ask?"

"I was just thinking," Nadine said, unsure whether to continue.  "He looks an awful lot like that boy who came here."

Natalie jerked, upending the tea tray.  The saucer, spoon, and cup flew through the air, spilling the tea across half of the dark quilt.

"Why, you cussed little thing!" she half yelled.

"Mom, I'm sorry--"

"You aggravating little wretch."  Natalie held her hands above her chest and looked with disgust at the mess that had spread over the bed around and on top of her.

"Mom, I didn't mean--"

"You never mean it, Nadine.  You and Mrs. O'Leary's cow."

"Mrs O--"

"Just clean this up.  Bring me a fresh quilt."

"Do you want some more tea?"

"Just clean up this mess and stay out of my sight."

Nadine gathered the tea dishes, placed them on the tea tray, and lifted the tray off the bed.

"Nadine," Natalie said, "You are not to speak of that boy again.  Am I understood?"

"Yes, Mom.  I'm sorry."

"You are not to speak of him again."

Nadine carried the tea tray quickly through the doorway and set it on the floor outside the bedroom.  Then she returned to the bed and picked up the photo album.

Natalie gripped the loosed photo leaf in both hands, staring at the photo an odd expression on her face.

Nadine reached for the leaf.

Natalie jerked the leaf away.  "Leave it," she said.  "Leave me alone."

Nadine turned and carried the binder out of the room.  Behind her, her mother made a mewling sound in her throat.
