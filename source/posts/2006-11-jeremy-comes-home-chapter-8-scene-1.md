Jeremy did not own a jacket.  When stepped off the bus into the pre-dawn drizzle of Portland, the damp, cold air chilled his body.  He shivered and wrapped his arms around himself to keep warm.

His breath made clouds as he looked around.  He had expected Aaron to be there when he arrived, to greet him warmly, to exchange long-delayed familial smiles.  Instead he stood in the cold.

Where was Aaron?

In front of Jeremy was the bus station.  It would have vending machines.  And heat.

"Jeremy."

Jeremy turned to his right to see a man who looked at once familiar and strange.  On the long bus ride Jeremy had tried to imagine what his now twenty-one year old brother would look like.  He had remembered his brother as much larger than he himself was, and rugged.  The Aaron Crowther who stood before him was slim and pale.

But this was his brother all right.  His brother who had called for him.  His only family and, for the moment, family enough.

"Aaron.  You don't know how good it is to see you."

"We should get you out of the cold.  I didn't think to bring you a coat."

"Aaron..."  Jeremy stepped toward Aaron, opening his arms to his brother.

For a moment, Aaron did not move.  Then he stepped forward.  Jeremy felt Aaron's arms surround him, then draw him closer, then release him.

Jeremy shivered.

"It's good to see you again, Aaron.  It's been too long.  You used to be bigger."  Jeremy laughed and his teeth chattered.

"Thank you for coming, Jeremy.  Come on.  My truck is still warm."

Jeremy looked at Aaron.  He had expected something more.

"Hey," Aaron said and removed his coat.

He held the coat out and Jeremy slid his arms into it and pulled it close around him.  It smelled like Aaron.  It reminded him of home.

"Now let's go.  I'm freezing my ass off out here."
