Foley sipped his coffee.  He checked each door frequently.  Aaron had said he would arrive in ten or fifteen minutes.

Two small racks beside the Yamhill door held a suite of local community newspapers.  Foley walked over, grabbed one of the newspapers at random, and took it back to his table.  He tried to read it, but he was too fatigued and distracted to concentrate on the words.

The coffee was slightly cooler now.  Foley took a long draw.  He checked the doors again, first Yamhill then Fourteenth Street.

A uniformed police officer came in through the Fourteenth Street door and looked around the coffee shop, clearly looking for someone.

Jesus!  Foley jerked his chair backward and looked toward the Yamill Street door.  Another uniformed officer turned and locked his gaze on Foley.

Foley turned toward the Fourteenth Street door.

The first officer advanced toward him and said, "Foley!  Hands in the air!"

Foley raised his hands slowly.

Aaron had set him up.  That little fucker had set him up.
